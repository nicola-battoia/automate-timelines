Yeah. [laughs] Oftentimes, this is just enough to solve the problem reliably. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Because, uh, there is maybe a tendency now to use generative AI with these large language models for- Mm-hmm ... to solve any kind of problems. Or I... there is this, um, possibility at least, right? Mm-hmm. And, um, from simple things like using ChatGPT as a, as a consumer, as a user, and you're asking it to, to translate apple to Italian- Yeah ... and, and it's like using, um, I don't know, atomic bomb to, to- [laughs] ... kill a mosquito, right? I've, I've- Yeah. [laughs] ... heard someone saying that. [laughs] [laughs] Because we, we... I mean, we can think about it, but, um, the normal people using ChatGPT doesn't realize that it's, it's a huge technology, right? There are data centers and, uh, transformers and all, uh... incredible technology behind it that transfer for every simple, uh, conversation that you have- Mm-hmm ... with ChatGPT, right? Mm-hmm. While for many, many things, it's not needed that, that so intelligent technology, you know, what I mean? Yeah, but I would say that's a big distinction between- Mm-hmm ... um, between the predictive modeling models with, uh, GenAI or LM models because predictive modeling is largely discriminative models. And then the LM, like the things that, you know, ChatGPT or whoever's coined a term like AI- Mm-hmm ... the big umbrella term, they are largely generative. And so they have different usage. So in, in, in terms of, like, what you said, it's-... you know, I, I want to do translation. Then a generative model can do that very well because, um, you know, you can, you can put, like, a, like a, you know, good prompt and then it's going to come up with an equivalent version of, like, the translation. But then in predictive modeling projects, what it needs is not creativity. What this needs is not generating new stuff, but to reliably, based on past data points, to accurately predict things. So if you take time series forecasting as an example, uh, maybe they have very sparse data, they don't need a model, like an LM, to tell, \\\"Hey, can you help me detect anomalies at which point in time when this happens?\\\" Because a generative model is most likely to make things up. Mm-hmm. But a predictive model or discriminative model, it's going to train the model based on the past data and then if the quality is good and if the model is... ha- has been trained successfully, it can then accurately predict in time, uh, what would be the... what would the anomal- a mono- [laughs] anomaly be. Anomaly. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So they are for kind of, like, different usage and that is why I think there are certain use cases for, um, LMs. There are certain use cases that, um, the discriminative machine learning models or statistical models will still be in, in demand because they are inherently for different, different things.\",\n",

So it's kinda like a dream, it's kinda like a dew, and like a morning dew. It's kinda like, um, illusion. It's kinda like a shadow.

It's going to end in, I don't know, like 20 minutes' time. And I should not cling on it. I should not think about, \\\"Oh, damn, I should change something about it.\\\" Like, also in freelancing- Yes ... it's like, uh, in freelancing you have to have a level of grace, uh, and compassion to yourself for the courage to come out. If you always say that, \\\"I have to be perfect. I cannot make any mistakes,\\\" sorry, you live in a classroom. You're not living in the real world. Hmm. Um, if you're living in the real world and you don't want to get to insanity, [laughs] just try to do a small experiment, see what it comes back. And if it is not the outcome that you want, just pivot and do better next time. So, like, don't hug the log when you have to climb the mountain. Yes, the log has saved you.

So that book is about taking Dante's Inferno- Ah ... into examining our life. And so it says that it, it goes through... You have to go through the center of the Earth- Mm ... and then go to the inferno and then coming out from the other side. And so that book is such a- Mm-hmm ... supernova for me. Like... [laughs] Yeah. Because, um, back then, I just take every advice as is and thinking that if I apply them, um, I'm going to get success or get happier. But I forgot to examine myself, like if that advice is made for me or not. Like, do I see myself in this, or do I have a level of understanding that this thing fits me or not? Um, and the process of doing that is then to, to find the truth slowly. And that book, The Way of Integrity, it's basically, like, explaining or practicing or making you realize what are the ways that you can find your own integrity. And so you have this inner truth as your anchor, and everything has to filter through this, and then you get a sense of clarity, um, when dealing with a lot of noise. I see. So it's, like, helping you to, um, filter the advice and whatever, [clears throat] whatever people tell you instead of following, uh, everyone in all... in every direction. Yeah. Yeah. It's more like there are two kinds of heart. Um, there are two kinds of hardness, um, that, that we face. Um, one kind of heart is if you're a fish, then if you want to swim to the ocean, and then, you know, like, it's a different environment, you just have to push on, right? Like, you have a, you know... You'll be stronger as a different f- as a stronger fish, you'll maybe swim faster or anything. But another kind of heart is you don't know who you are, you don't even know you're a fish, and then you are trying to compete with monkeys climbing the tree, and then you'll be stuck thinking, \\\"Why are the other monkeys just seem so, so light and easy and so effortless in climbing the trees?\\\" Because you don't even know, like... And, and you're kinda out of breath. [laughs] You're not as good as they are. You're not achieving the height that they are, but you're half dying.

I've, I've- Yeah. [laughs] ... heard someone saying that. [laughs] [laughs] Because we, we... I mean, we can think about it, but, um, the normal people using ChatGPT doesn't realize that it's, it's a huge technology, right? There are data centers and, uh, transformers and all, uh... incredible technology behind it that transfer for every simple, uh, conversation that you have- Mm-hmm ... with ChatGPT, right? Mm-hmm. While for many, many things, it's not needed that, that so intelligent technology, you know, what I mean? Yeah, but I would say that's a big distinction between- Mm-hmm ... um, between the predictive modeling models with, uh, GenAI or LM models because predictive modeling is largely discriminative models. And then the LM, like the things that, you know, ChatGPT or whoever's coined a term like AI- Mm-hmm ... the big umbrella term, they are largely generative. And so they have different usage. So in, in, in terms of, like, what you said, it's-... you know, I, I want to do translation. Then a generative model can do that very well because, um, you can, you can put, like, a, like a, you know, good prompt and then it's going to come up with an equivalent version of, like, the translation. But then in predictive modeling projects, what it needs is not creativity. What this needs is not generating new stuff, but to reliably, based on past data points, to accurately predict things. So if you take time series forecasting as an example, uh, maybe they have very sparse data, they don't need a model, like an LM, to tell, \\\"Hey, can you help me detect anomalies at which point in time when this happens?\\\" Because a generative model is most likely to make things up. Mm-hmm. But a predictive model or discriminative model, it's going to train the model based on the past data and then if the quality is good and if the model is... ha- has been trained successfully, it can then accurately predict in time, uh, what would be the... what would the anomal- a mono- [laughs] anomaly be. Anomaly. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So they are for kind of, like, different usage and that is why I think there are certain use cases for, um, LMs. There are certain use cases that, um, the discriminative machine learning models or statistical models will still be in, in demand because they are inherently for different, different things.\",\n",

Like, you have a, you know... You'll be stronger as a different f- as a stronger fish, you'll maybe swim faster or anything. But another kind of heart is you don't know who you are, you don't even know you're a fish, and then you are trying to compete with monkeys climbing the tree, and then you'll be stuck thinking, \\\"Why are the other monkeys just seem so, so light and easy and so effortless in climbing the trees?\\\" Because you don't even know, like... And, and you're kinda out of breath. [laughs] You're not as good as they are. You're not achieving the height that they are, but you're half dying.
