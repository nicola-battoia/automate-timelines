00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,500 [Nicola]
Hi, Hwei. Thank you so much for, for doing

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,040 [Nicola]
this. I took this chance to, to learn a

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,380 [Nicola]
bit more about you,

00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,460 [Nicola]
uh, [laughs] because I think that you have

00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,600 [Nicola]
very cool things to, to share.

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,560 [Hwei]
Let, let's hope so. Thanks for having me,

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,820 [Hwei]
and I really look forward to our good

00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,900 [Hwei]
conversation today.

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,740 [Nicola]
[laughs] Cool. Amazing. So

00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,100 [Nicola]
let's get started. Uh, you were, you were

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,020 [Nicola]
sharing the

00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,560 [Nicola]
most amazing stories-

00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:29,610 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,320 [Nicola]
... so I'll [laughs]-

00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:31,330 [Hwei]
That's it

00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:31,330 [Nicola]
...

00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,780 [Nicola]
I'll go from, from there because there is,

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,280 [Nicola]
uh, some magic there. So-

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,600 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,140 [Nicola]
... yeah, before that, maybe a brief

00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,680 [Nicola]
introduction on what we might touch on. We

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,520 [Nicola]
know each other from the program Data

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,820 [Nicola]
Freelancer-

00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:47,930 [Hwei]
Yeah

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,260 [Nicola]
... where, where you h- helped people to

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,300 [Nicola]
get started in the, their data and AI

00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,480 [Nicola]
freelance journey. And I was curious, um,

00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,650 [Nicola]
preparing for, for this interview, uh,

00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,200 [Nicola]
where all this started. I think there's

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,820 [Nicola]
always interesting stories there.

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,910 [Hwei]
Well, your question make me, like, um,

00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,820 [Hwei]
kind of like rewind to many, many years

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,170 [Hwei]
ago.

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,650 [Nicola]
Yeah [laughs].

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,860 [Hwei]
Uh, I just, like, graduated from high

00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,020 [Hwei]
school, and, uh, to be honest, I'm, I'm,

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,660 [Hwei]
like, not very tech-savvy at that time.

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:19,800 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,420 [Hwei]
Like, I just, [laughs] I just learned how

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,180 [Hwei]
to use the internet for, like, the second

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,920 [Hwei]
or the third year. Um, [laughs] uh, and

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,600 [Hwei]
then, um, I came across this thing called

00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,820 [Hwei]
YouTube, and then, uh, for some divine

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,020 [Hwei]
intervention, I just watched a

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,740 [Hwei]
Microsoft

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,820 [Hwei]
Vision 2020 video. So that was like, you

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560 [Hwei]
can imagine, like, I mean, we are now in

00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,420 [Hwei]
2025-

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,330 [Nicola]
[laughs]

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,220 [Hwei]
... but I was watching, like, a, a video

00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,800 [Hwei]
of what Microsoft envisioned Vision

00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320 [Hwei]
2020 to be

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,460 [Hwei]
in twen- in, in 2008.

00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,580 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,440 [Hwei]
So [laughs] and my 2008 high school self

00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,340 [Hwei]
just got, like, blown

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,680 [Hwei]
away, uh, with that video because it is,

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,400 [Hwei]
you know, it starts with like, "You can

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,870 [Hwei]
communicate with, uh, people in another

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,730 [Hwei]
country." It's auto-translated [laughs].

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,060 [Hwei]
And then, uh, there's this like, you know,

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,240 [Hwei]
like, uh, transparent glass panel with

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,520 [Hwei]
text popping up like, "Oh, your, your

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,660 [Hwei]
thing is done. Oh, this person has this

00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,220 [Hwei]
update." You'd see dashboard and

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,300 [Hwei]
everything. At that time, it was just,

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,860 [Hwei]
like, unfathomable. And so

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,340 [Hwei]
out of curiosity, because I was, like,

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,260 [Hwei]
like, too... Was still amazed, uh, with

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,420 [Hwei]
that thing, I commented under the video,

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,280 [Hwei]
[laughs] uh, and says like, uh, "Wow,

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,840 [Hwei]
this is such a great video. I am a high

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,230 [Hwei]
school graduate, uh,

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,300 [Hwei]
trying to figure out what should I study

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,800 [Hwei]
for university. Can anybody [laughs] tell

00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,000 [Hwei]
me what should I study in the university

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,220 [Hwei]
just to be a part of this magic?" And

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,880 [Hwei]
then, [laughs] a stranger of, a, a

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,040 [Hwei]
stranger in the internet, whoever sees

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,560 [Hwei]
this comment, um,

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,200 [Hwei]
that person replied that says, "You should

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,960 [Hwei]
just go for computer science."

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,450 [Nicola]
[laughs]

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,540 [Hwei]
And I'm like, "Whoever that is, thank you

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,280 [Hwei]
so much. You're one of the reason [laughs]

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,060 [Hwei]
why I'm here today, uh, as a data

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,590 [Hwei]
scientist and AI engineer in 2025."

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,769 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,880 [Nicola]
We need... We all need to thank that, that

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,860 [Nicola]
YouTube commenter. [laughs]

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:30,870 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,500 [Nicola]
The magic of YouTube.

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,680 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:33,750 [Nicola]
Amazing.

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,340 [Hwei]
A gesture of kindness. Yeah.

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,680 [Nicola]
Yes.

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,680 [Hwei]
So it's sparked by inspiration really-

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,210 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,620 [Hwei]
... of magic-making.

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,280 [Nicola]
Okay, so from, from there, you, you

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,300 [Nicola]
started the traditional path of computer

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,540 [Nicola]
science.

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,040 [Hwei]
Actually, software engineering. So, um-

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:51,690 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,600 [Hwei]
So at that time,

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,820 [Hwei]
I was living in, uh, a small town-

00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,850 [Nicola]
Okay

00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,440 [Hwei]
... that is like four hours away from the

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,240 [Hwei]
capital city, um, of Malaysia, Kuala

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:02,740 [Hwei]
Lumpur.

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,340 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,520 [Hwei]
And so I pick one university to go and

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,520 [Hwei]
study. Um, but, uh,

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,540 [Hwei]
so, you know, like, at that time, you do

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,880 [Hwei]
foundation in IT, and after one year, um,

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,420 [Hwei]
I, I was going to, like, computer science.

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,860 [Hwei]
But then, uh, the, the school admission

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,760 [Hwei]
says, "Hey, you are the only one who

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,469 [Hwei]
registered for computer science. Do you

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,240 [Hwei]
mind, like, changing a course?" [laughs]

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,510 [Nicola]
Really? Okay.

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,540 [Hwei]
And so I changed, yeah. And so I changed

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400 [Hwei]
to software engineering, um, actually

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880 [Hwei]
software engineering with mult- with

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,300 [Hwei]
multimedia.

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:35,310 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,580 [Hwei]
And so in that four years,

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,810 [Hwei]
um, a fascinating tech came out, which is

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,190 [Hwei]
called, uh, AR and VR, so augmented

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,180 [Hwei]
reality and virtual reality.

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,210 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,100 [Hwei]
And so me and my friends, we were just,

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,540 [Hwei]
uh, involved in, um, like,

00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,080 [Hwei]
just projects using augmented reality, and

00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,620 [Hwei]
then we participated in, you know, like,

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,680 [Hwei]
Microsoft Imagine Cup and things like

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,160 [Hwei]
this. Yeah, so that was bachelor's time.

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,850 [Hwei]
Good time. [laughs] It's been some time.

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,140 [Nicola]
Cool, and, and then how... Because now

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,420 [Nicola]
you're, you're not in Malaysia anymore,

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,860 [Nicola]
right?

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,780 [Hwei]
[laughs] Yes. 10 years. 10 years in

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,060 [Hwei]
Germany now.

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,100 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,110 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,420 [Nicola]
And how, how do you like Germany?

00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,010 [Hwei]
It's great.

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,130 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,460 [Hwei]
I just saw one of the first Christmas,

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,280 [Hwei]
Christmas market booths [laughs] today

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,960 [Hwei]
that's getting set up.

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:32,990 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm. Okay.

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,620 [Hwei]
So yeah, Christmas market is one of the

00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,780 [Hwei]
things that I look forward each year in

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,460 [Hwei]
Germany. But yeah, Germany is

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,260 [Hwei]
for this 10 years, I think, uh, I really

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,400 [Hwei]
have to thank this country for it because-

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:45,560 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,420 [Hwei]
... it really, um, grows me as a person. I

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,380 [Hwei]
feel like, I, I feel like I've, I've

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,340 [Hwei]
grown a lot in this last 10 years.

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,860 [Nicola]
Really? Okay. And you, you think-

00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:55,930 [Hwei]
Yeah

00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,720 [Nicola]
... uh, that Germany help you to, to,

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,900 [Nicola]
to grow personally? In, in which way?

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,600 [Hwei]
Hmm. Yeah, I would say fundamentally, uh-

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:04,670 [Nicola]
Okay

00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,090 [Hwei]
... because, you know, like, I, I've

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,340 [Hwei]
basically uprooted myself in one culture,

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,200 [Hwei]
one country, one environment, and then

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,200 [Hwei]
being put into, like, such a different

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,306 [Hwei]
environment....

00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:15,556 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,576 [Hwei]
And so, I think the greatest things that

00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:20,016 [Hwei]
Germany has made space for me

00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:25,656 [Hwei]
is to... is to know who I am as a person,

00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,476 [Hwei]
what I prefer, what my

00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,276 [Hwei]
thoughts and preferences are,

00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:33,256 [Hwei]
and what do I want. And then I can go

00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:35,776 [Hwei]
towards that. And so, I would say in

00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:40,156 [Hwei]
general, like this, um, individual-

00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:41,946 [Hwei]
individuation, uh-

00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:42,086 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:44,716 [Hwei]
... this is what, uh, Germany has given me

00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:47,596 [Hwei]
space to grow into.

00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:50,156 [Nicola]
Cool. Yeah, I, I've lived in Germany as

00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:53,236 [Nicola]
well, and I, I think there are some, some

00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:56,236 [Nicola]
very traditional aspects of, of German

00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,276 [Nicola]
culture.

00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:57,456 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:06:57,476 --> 00:07:00,276 [Nicola]
But also there is, um, a big part of

00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:04,476 [Nicola]
letting everyone be who they want to be-

00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:04,996 [Hwei]
That's right

00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,876 [Nicola]
... in all weird ways. They-

00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:07,036 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:10,506 [Nicola]
... they accept and are very- [laughs]

00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:10,696 [Hwei]
Yeah

00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:11,016 [Nicola]
... very

00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:14,496 [Nicola]
particular, you know. And there is n- not

00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:17,416 [Nicola]
n- not that much judgment around that

00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:18,436 [Nicola]
compared to-

00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:18,596 [Hwei]
Yeah

00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:20,776 [Nicola]
... to other countries or other cultures.

00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:21,095 [Nicola]
Yeah.

00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:22,896 [Hwei]
Yeah. That's right. And so-

00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:22,946 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:23,296 [Hwei]
... like,

00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:26,656 [Hwei]
I, I think this is the, the right place,

00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:29,446 [Hwei]
um, that I'm being put in-

00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:29,506 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:31,606 [Hwei]
... to actually grow as a person. Like, I

00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:34,486 [Hwei]
know I am not anybody's shadow this way.

00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:35,576 [Hwei]
I'm just me.

00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:40,116 [Nicola]
Okay, cool. I, I, I remember that, uh, y-

00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:42,176 [Nicola]
you shared with me some, some time ago

00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,656 [Nicola]
that, that maybe you realized a few, a few

00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,216 [Nicola]
changes when, when you went back to, to

00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:51,116 [Nicola]
Malaysia after, after some time, right?

00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:51,326 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:53,046 [Nicola]
I, I mean, this happen to me as well. When

00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,996 [Nicola]
I go back to my hometown, home place,

00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:57,496 [Nicola]
after some times, I realize

00:07:58,556 --> 00:08:00,456 [Nicola]
I've, I've, I'm not anymore the person

00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:03,476 [Nicola]
was, that was living there, and, uh, I

00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,896 [Nicola]
cannot fit anymore in that place because

00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:09,396 [Nicola]
I've grown in different ways, right?

00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:11,836 [Hwei]
Yeah, I think no matter where you go-

00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:11,866 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,136 [Hwei]
... if you are an expat, um, you feel like

00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:18,826 [Hwei]
the version of home that you... that,

00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,596 [Hwei]
that you were familiar with but you

00:08:20,676 --> 00:08:23,705 [Hwei]
leave, um, will just be a snapshot in the

00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:26,536 [Hwei]
past because, I mean, Malaysia has grown

00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:29,036 [Hwei]
so much in these recent years.

00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:29,046 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:30,556 [Hwei]
And so, I think as

00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:34,145 [Hwei]
an expat, no matter where you go, um,

00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:35,696 [Hwei]
you feel like

00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:40,145 [Hwei]
you never belong in the place that, um,

00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:41,776 [Hwei]
you grow into-

00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:41,805 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:44,456 [Hwei]
... but you're also never home anymore,

00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:48,386 [Hwei]
because home as... has also evolved. But I

00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,465 [Hwei]
don't think that is... I don't

00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,965 [Hwei]
think there's any issue with that because-

00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:53,965 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,056 [Hwei]
... this is the path that

00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:58,396 [Hwei]
all of us expats have chosen

00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:03,716 [Hwei]
and what's most important is to... as long

00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,036 [Hwei]
as you are feeling you, uh,

00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:07,236 [Hwei]
and as long as you're living

00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,556 [Hwei]
authentically, home is where you are. Home

00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:12,636 [Hwei]
is not the snapshot that you're left

00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:15,876 [Hwei]
alone with. Home is also not

00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,656 [Hwei]
like... y- you don't necessarily feel like

00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:22,906 [Hwei]
100% fitting in, uh, into anything, but I

00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:25,096 [Hwei]
am pretty sure, like a lot of locals

00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:28,236 [Hwei]
will also share that, uh, maybe they also

00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:30,736 [Hwei]
don't feel like they fit into the place

00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:32,886 [Hwei]
that they have been like growing up in.

00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,036 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,886 [Hwei]
So I think essentially,

00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:41,016 [Hwei]
having this... having this experience just

00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:41,736 [Hwei]
teach us

00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:46,296 [Hwei]
to realize that... m- to realize that home

00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,136 [Hwei]
is really where you are.

00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:51,696 [Nicola]
Yeah. That's, [laughs] that's, that's the

00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,156 [Nicola]
goal, right? And to, to

00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:56,726 [Nicola]
build your home where, where you are, um,

00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:59,596 [Nicola]
be, be good with, with you, which is a

00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:02,496 [Nicola]
journey in, in itself, I, I guess.

00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:02,745 [Hwei]
Mm.

00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:03,456 [Nicola]
Yeah.

00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:04,336 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,166 [Nicola]
Interesting. [laughs]

00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:06,416 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:11,176 [Nicola]
And where, where in all this, um, AI fits?

00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:12,216 [Nicola]
[laughs]

00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:14,376 [Hwei]
Oh, okay. Where, where do we... where

00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,496 [Hwei]
we... what, what did we, uh, have the

00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,656 [Hwei]
story last time? Yeah, software

00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:21,636 [Hwei]
engineering.

00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:21,666 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:23,866 [Hwei]
And I came to Germany to study, um,

00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:26,036 [Hwei]
intelligent adaptive systems, so I started

00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:28,196 [Hwei]
my master's in the University of Hamburg

00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:33,076 [Hwei]
in 2015, so [laughs] 10 years ago. Um,

00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:35,436 [Hwei]
yeah. So, uh, that

00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:41,196 [Hwei]
is, um... that three years, uh, is such a

00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:41,896 [Hwei]
eye-opener

00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:43,096 [Hwei]
because-

00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:43,216 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:45,356 [Hwei]
... that's when I really learned the ins

00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,476 [Hwei]
and outs, like,

00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:48,616 [Hwei]
hardcore research

00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:51,616 [Hwei]
and application of machine learning, deep

00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:54,516 [Hwei]
learning. I was working on this, uh,

00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,976 [Hwei]
humanoid robotics projects and some

00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,356 [Hwei]
sensors, you know, pairing that with

00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:02,256 [Hwei]
machine learning and training humanoid

00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:05,056 [Hwei]
robotics and doing computer vision and all

00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:05,356 [Hwei]
that.

00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:09,116 [Nicola]
What, what do you think of, uh, the last,

00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:12,976 [Nicola]
um, humanoid robot thing that, um, came

00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:14,876 [Nicola]
out last week, I think?

00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:15,176 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,256 [Nicola]
This, to me, weird-

00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:17,326 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:20,156 [Nicola]
... robot with the, with the sweater that

00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,176 [Nicola]
[laughs]... you know, the Neo, Neo I think

00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,536 [Nicola]
it's called, uh, Neo-

00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:24,696 [Hwei]
Yeah

00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:26,236 [Nicola]
... something.

00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:26,746 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:26,866 [Nicola]
I think-

00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,736 [Hwei]
I wouldn't give up things, but the, the,

00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:31,376 [Hwei]
the humanoid robot, uh, the humanoid robot

00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:33,396 [Hwei]
that I was working on-

00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:33,446 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:36,246 [Hwei]
... uh, also starts with N. [laughs]

00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:36,876 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,366 [Hwei]
Um [laughs]-

00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,336 [Nicola]
Interesting.

00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,356 [Hwei]
Um, yeah. Um-

00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:41,496 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:44,256 [Hwei]
... you, you guys sort of share very

00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:46,766 [Hwei]
similar names. Um, but then

00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,056 [Hwei]
when I think about that version of the

00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,226 [Hwei]
robot with-

00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:51,436 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:55,076 [Hwei]
... this version, I think-

00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:55,086 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:55,086 [Hwei]
...

00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,246 [Hwei]
it, it, it, it needs some...

00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:00,736 [Hwei]
maybe give it five more years-

00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:01,076 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:03,856 [Hwei]
... uh, for another breakthrough. Um, I

00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,056 [Hwei]
think it's more like

00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,276 [Hwei]
maybe humanoid robotic is developing a

00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:10,176 [Hwei]
little bit, you know, needing... it, it's

00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:12,096 [Hwei]
needing more time for all the

00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:14,876 [Hwei]
non-deterministic situations,

00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,756 [Hwei]
non-deterministic scenarios in real life,

00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:18,276 [Hwei]
um-

00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:19,362 [Nicola]
Gosh.

00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:24,402 [Hwei]
So, I feel that... Yeah. [laughs] Uh-

00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:25,072 [Nicola]
It takes-

00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:25,182 [Hwei]
... if-

00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:27,452 [Nicola]
... much more time than, than people

00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:28,892 [Nicola]
expect, right?

00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:30,512 [Hwei]
Yeah, but I think it's also the, the,

00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:34,292 [Hwei]
the perception. The audience perception of

00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:35,012 [Hwei]
it.

00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:35,232 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:37,112 [Hwei]
Because humanoid robotics, this can... It

00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:39,552 [Hwei]
can be borderline like uncanny, you know?

00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:39,672 [Nicola]
Yeah.

00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:43,272 [Hwei]
And so, [laughs] and so, mm, the, the mode

00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,112 [Hwei]
of presentation has to be a little bit

00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,252 [Hwei]
careful because-

00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:46,552 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:50,552 [Hwei]
... if you, if you present things like,

00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:52,812 [Hwei]
hey, you have a person that is maneuvering

00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:54,182 [Hwei]
the robot, which means, like,

00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,572 [Hwei]
what about the privacy inside? I, I'd-

00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:56,742 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:58,912 [Hwei]
... um ... [laughs]

00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:00,432 [Nicola]
That, that's definitely-

00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:00,462 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:01,382 [Nicola]
... unexpected.

00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:02,882 [Nicola]
[laughs] Yeah.

00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,872 [Hwei]
Yeah. But I think that is the safest way

00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:05,972 [Hwei]
for the team-

00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:06,102 [Nicola]
Uh-huh

00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:06,762 [Hwei]
... to actually

00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:08,952 [Hwei]
s- um,

00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:12,172 [Hwei]
in a, in a more controllable way

00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,932 [Hwei]
ensuring the accuracy-

00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:15,022 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:17,312 [Hwei]
... of the humanoid robot. And so I would

00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:19,852 [Hwei]
give it some grace, but I also totally

00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:20,512 [Hwei]
understand

00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:24,672 [Hwei]
how uncanny it can feel when,

00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:28,972 [Hwei]
when us just put ourself in the shoes of

00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:31,952 [Hwei]
the consumer, of the user, and then

00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,072 [Hwei]
extrapolate this presentation

00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:37,392 [Hwei]
into what might be in the future.

00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:38,392 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:38,772 [Hwei]
Um, so

00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,192 [Hwei]
yeah. If you, if anybody's thinking about,

00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,812 [Hwei]
you know, "Shit, the future is doom,"

00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:46,012 [Hwei]
[laughs] I can totally understand. Like,

00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:48,632 [Hwei]
this is just a, I think, the handling of

00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:51,132 [Hwei]
the presentation into what

00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:54,222 [Hwei]
the audience might feel. Like, that, that,

00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:58,072 [Hwei]
that, that can be more considerate.

00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,032 [Nicola]
Yeah. Right, because they, the, the end

00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,112 [Nicola]
goal, I mean, not, not everyone will, will

00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:05,002 [Nicola]
see it the same way, but

00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,462 [Nicola]
most people would love to have

00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:11,132 [Nicola]
someone, if it is a robot, it's fine to

00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:14,082 [Nicola]
then do all the household stuff for you,

00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:16,842 [Nicola]
right? That, that, that is great. But

00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:18,562 [Nicola]
it... I feel the technology will

00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:23,072 [Nicola]
need more time than, than expected, even

00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,232 [Nicola]
if Elon Musk, I think, will, is saying

00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:25,472 [Nicola]
that

00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,011 [Nicola]
in the next few years will be

00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,812 [Nicola]
there in every home, something like that.

00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:33,592 [Nicola]
But you have been working, for example,

00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:36,732 [Nicola]
um, on this from 2015, right?

00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:36,821 [Hwei]
Hmm.

00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:36,992 [Nicola]
And

00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:40,672 [Nicola]
you, you think, uh, uh, it has advance a

00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:43,992 [Nicola]
lot in these 10 years or it's a long

00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:48,072 [Nicola]
incremental journey?

00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,232 [Hwei]
I don't think it's going to be

00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:51,412 [Hwei]
incremental. I think it's going to be

00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:54,252 [Hwei]
exponential, uh, from the rate of

00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,332 [Hwei]
development. Um,

00:14:57,652 --> 00:15:00,592 [Hwei]
I think it still depends on how the world

00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:02,321 [Hwei]
is moving

00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:03,802 [Hwei]
and

00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,192 [Hwei]
being somebody who have worked briefly,

00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:08,832 [Hwei]
um,

00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:12,552 [Hwei]
in humanoid robotics afterwards, I mean, I

00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:16,442 [Hwei]
have some years in research, um, also in

00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:18,672 [Hwei]
synthetic patient data generation feel,

00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:20,912 [Hwei]
what I think is

00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:25,272 [Hwei]
I can almost hear two sides of things. Um,

00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:28,692 [Hwei]
one is the voice of the rest of the world

00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:29,462 [Hwei]
who are not

00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:32,132 [Hwei]
in the research and who are not in the

00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:32,512 [Hwei]
work,

00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,092 [Hwei]
uh, having to apply it. Their, their

00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,652 [Hwei]
concern is real.

00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:37,812 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:40,392 [Hwei]
And so that should not be ignored. That

00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:44,512 [Hwei]
should be leaned in and listened to. It

00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,312 [Hwei]
has to be a dialogue, um,

00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:48,352 [Hwei]
for how this, um,

00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:53,312 [Hwei]
for how this can be done in a way that

00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:55,472 [Hwei]
essentially is affecting everybody, to be

00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:59,832 [Hwei]
honest. Um, and people, like, voices from

00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:01,072 [Hwei]
all sides has to be

00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,772 [Hwei]
considered.

00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:03,902 [Nicola]
Yeah. Yeah.

00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:06,992 [Hwei]
Um, but then on the other hand, um, for us

00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:09,652 [Hwei]
who are the practitioners of the field,

00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:13,772 [Hwei]
of the tech, I see a lot of possibilities.

00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:16,432 [Hwei]
I see a lot of values to be done,

00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:16,782 [Hwei]
um-

00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:16,862 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:20,232 [Hwei]
... especially in the work that I do for

00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,272 [Hwei]
clients right now. Um,

00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:24,052 [Hwei]
what I see is

00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,632 [Hwei]
intention really matters and

00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:29,592 [Hwei]
what

00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:34,972 [Hwei]
problems are you solving and for who. Um,

00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:36,382 [Hwei]
humans have to come up with this

00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,332 [Hwei]
first and foremost, and then the tech

00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:43,462 [Hwei]
comes in too. You know, make it, make it

00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,912 [Hwei]
happen in reality. And so

00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:49,332 [Hwei]
I think what we can control right now is

00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:53,192 [Hwei]
whoever is needing the solution and

00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:56,752 [Hwei]
whoever, like us, is executing or

00:16:56,812 --> 00:17:00,372 [Hwei]
implementing these solutions, figuring out

00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:00,972 [Hwei]
for what

00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:03,452 [Hwei]
and for who. It's kind of

00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,252 [Hwei]
our due diligence.

00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:09,472 [Hwei]
Um, and when it's done right, I do see a

00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:12,271 [Hwei]
lot of possibilities, uh, with the current

00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:16,072 [Hwei]
LM advancements. Uh, and it's just like

00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:18,432 [Hwei]
the, the, the, the

00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:21,472 [Hwei]
general, um, you know, gen AI feel-

00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:21,592 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:23,712 [Hwei]
... how it's evolving. Uh, it, it is

00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,232 [Hwei]
really fascinating.

00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,332 [Nicola]
Yeah. I mean, we, we of course sh- share

00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,092 [Nicola]
this fascination, right?

00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:31,102 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:34,272 [Nicola]
Because we see all the possibilities. Um,

00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:37,612 [Nicola]
but in the, in the last years as this has

00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:38,132 [Nicola]
become a

00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,412 [Nicola]
universal phenomenon and everybody is, is

00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:44,092 [Nicola]
talking about generative AI and all this

00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:48,072 [Nicola]
stuff, there are all sorts of, of voices

00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:51,232 [Nicola]
and things going on. Uh, people are

00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:52,852 [Nicola]
scared or are,

00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:56,892 [Nicola]
um, thoughts around, you know, all these

00:17:56,972 --> 00:18:00,152 [Nicola]
things. AGI will, will take, um, many

00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:00,852 [Nicola]
jobs and

00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:04,032 [Nicola]
political things going on. So it's, it's a

00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:06,672 [Nicola]
mess, right? [laughs] We, we enjoy it

00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:09,532 [Nicola]
because we, we like to build things. I

00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,552 [Nicola]
think that's, that's the spirit, and we

00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:15,912 [Nicola]
see it's just, uh, as a technology, right?

00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:16,432 [Nicola]
Um,

00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,672 [Nicola]
but most people which are not into this

00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,146 [Nicola]
will hear the news, hear whatever, and-...

00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:26,075 [Nicola]
understand what they, what they can with,

00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:27,856 [Nicola]
with the information that they have.

00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:27,865 [Hwei]
Hmm.

00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,846 [Nicola]
So there is definitely a bridge there, uh,

00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,416 [Nicola]
to, to... There is a gap to, to,

00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:39,136 [Nicola]
to fill between these two, uh, worlds.

00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:40,116 [Nicola]
Right?

00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:40,356 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,426 [Nicola]
And, um, yeah. I guess, as you were

00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:46,075 [Nicola]
saying, it's, it's important to, to pick

00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:49,426 [Nicola]
the, the right things, uh, in a way and

00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,636 [Nicola]
do it well, but also communicate it in,

00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:55,456 [Nicola]
in, in the right way, uh, so that people

00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:57,956 [Nicola]
understand and don't have a weird

00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:01,376 [Nicola]
expectation or, or fears, you know. Is

00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:03,336 [Nicola]
that something that, that, that you feel,

00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:05,956 [Nicola]
that, uh, that you feel, uh, when, when

00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:08,476 [Nicola]
you work with, with clients or, uh,

00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,775 [Nicola]
interact with, uh, less technical people?

00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:15,836 [Hwei]
You mean, uh, when deal... When

00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:20,116 [Hwei]
communicating with less technical clients?

00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:21,626 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,044 [Hwei]
Um, am I understanding correctly that...

00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:28,275 [Hwei]
Do you think I feel that they care about

00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:30,216 [Hwei]
the for what and for who, or how should

00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:32,025 [Hwei]
I... How should I understand your

00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,136 [Hwei]
question?

00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:36,495 [Nicola]
Yeah. Eh, if, if you, you feel that there

00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:40,716 [Nicola]
is, um, a disconnection between, um, how

00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:43,065 [Nicola]
you see this technology and

00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,976 [Nicola]
what, uh, less technical people expect

00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:49,416 [Nicola]
from the technology or what they-

00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:50,216 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,636 [Nicola]
... um, uh, think about it. If they have

00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:56,716 [Nicola]
fears or, um,

00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:59,335 [Nicola]
how do you say this? Yeah.

00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:01,716 [Hwei]
For the clients that c- I come across-

00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:01,765 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:03,025 [Hwei]
... usually, um,

00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:06,795 [Hwei]
usually, it is not like I go and pitch

00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:08,196 [Hwei]
that they need a solution.

00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:08,426 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:20:08,426 --> 00:20:09,755 [Hwei]
It's more like they come to me that says

00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:13,096 [Hwei]
they need a solution. And so I would say

00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,576 [Hwei]
in my biased

00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:18,765 [Hwei]
small sample size experience, um,

00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,255 [Hwei]
there's less fear

00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:23,396 [Hwei]
when a client comes to me and said they

00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,315 [Hwei]
need a certain solution to be made. Um,

00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:29,295 [Hwei]
there can be, you know, the application of

00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:31,476 [Hwei]
machine learning or even, like,

00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:35,456 [Hwei]
statistics, um, like traditional, uh, data

00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:36,126 [Hwei]
insights-

00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:36,616 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:39,366 [Hwei]
... predictive modeling, or the bridge of,

00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,564 [Hwei]
like, taking predictive modeling insights

00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:45,535 [Hwei]
and then pair that with, um, LM

00:20:45,596 --> 00:20:48,436 [Hwei]
generation based on these insights. Um,

00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:49,456 [Hwei]
but usually

00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:51,936 [Hwei]
when they come to me, they already know

00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:55,116 [Hwei]
what they want. But then it's up to us to

00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:58,035 [Hwei]
say, "Okay, what is the best way to go

00:20:58,076 --> 00:20:58,495 [Hwei]
about it?

00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:03,456 [Hwei]
Do we care enough for the project to carry

00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:06,216 [Hwei]
on a good work for the client? Is the for

00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:08,555 [Hwei]
what and for who aligned with the

00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:10,765 [Hwei]
implementer as well?" It's like, do I feel

00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:13,576 [Hwei]
proud to put this piece of project in my

00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:14,126 [Hwei]
portfolio?

00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:14,945 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:17,366 [Hwei]
Uh, I think this is then regarding the

00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:20,396 [Hwei]
fit. And if it doesn't fit, just feel free

00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:22,476 [Hwei]
to, you know, uh, politely excuse

00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,436 [Hwei]
yourself of this opportunity.

00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:24,656 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:28,376 [Hwei]
Uh, but then, uh, what I am striving for

00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:29,015 [Hwei]
is

00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,956 [Hwei]
try to do things that,

00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:37,815 [Hwei]
that are for good, because this is part of

00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:38,476 [Hwei]
my values.

00:21:39,795 --> 00:21:42,156 [Hwei]
But for good is also kind of like, hey,

00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:43,956 [Hwei]
it's... it can be anything. Um-

00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:44,146 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:46,676 [Hwei]
[laughs] But for me, it's kind of like

00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:51,636 [Hwei]
something that I told, told a lot of our

00:21:51,716 --> 00:21:53,636 [Hwei]
members, our community members, is

00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,616 [Hwei]
when you look back at the things that you

00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:58,196 [Hwei]
do, even as a freelancer, content creator

00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,876 [Hwei]
or whatnot, um, it's okay to feel cringe,

00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,035 [Hwei]
but you don't really want to feel shame.

00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:05,466 [Nicola]
Hmm. Hmm. I see.

00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:07,416 [Hwei]
And so it's kind of like intention

00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:08,815 [Hwei]
matters.

00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:11,356 [Nicola]
Okay. So what's, what's an example of

00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,555 [Nicola]
something that you have been... you have

00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:15,916 [Nicola]
worked on that you're proud of it?

00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:17,936 [Hwei]
Quite many.

00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:18,436 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:20,755 [Hwei]
So right now, I am developing

00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:25,926 [Hwei]
a, an automated tool for a consumer goods

00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:27,916 [Hwei]
company to

00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:30,696 [Hwei]
help the data scientists come up with

00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:33,676 [Hwei]
stability tests. So basically, stability

00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:37,495 [Hwei]
test is like, um, you know, when consumer

00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:39,956 [Hwei]
goods have a expiry date, they have r- to

00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:41,775 [Hwei]
really, like, test their products over

00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:43,975 [Hwei]
some time and then use some algorithm to

00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:47,556 [Hwei]
come up with, um, expiry date.

00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:47,565 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:51,136 [Hwei]
So to me, I feel like this is a meaningful

00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:53,876 [Hwei]
project because I get to save the data

00:22:53,896 --> 00:22:54,576 [Hwei]
scientist's time

00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,656 [Hwei]
who come up with expiry date for consumer

00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:00,855 [Hwei]
goods, which this consumer goods will be

00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:03,925 [Hwei]
used by many, many people. And then

00:23:03,956 --> 00:23:07,096 [Hwei]
another project that I help, uh, to do

00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:12,616 [Hwei]
is, um, the, the pollutants monitoring of

00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:14,696 [Hwei]
the Rhine water, uh,

00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:15,495 [Hwei]
system.

00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:15,605 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm. Okay.

00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:19,326 [Hwei]
So basically, like, um, basically, like,

00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:21,775 [Hwei]
part of Germany and the Netherlands share

00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:25,666 [Hwei]
the same water system. And then, um,

00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:27,535 [Hwei]
I help build

00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:30,136 [Hwei]
sort of like a predictive modeling

00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:31,576 [Hwei]
tool

00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:36,525 [Hwei]
to kind of like say, "Hey, can we..." You

00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:39,156 [Hwei]
know, it's all sparse data, so and then

00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:41,306 [Hwei]
data is kind of like inconsistent and

00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:42,735 [Hwei]
everything, so a lot of processing is

00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:46,476 [Hwei]
involved. But that tool now manage to,

00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:49,096 [Hwei]
uh, kind of like predict

00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,616 [Hwei]
pollutants in time. To say like, "Hey,

00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:55,116 [Hwei]
when a pollutant is being detected

00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:56,035 [Hwei]
abnormally

00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:58,275 [Hwei]
at upstream rivers,

00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,716 [Hwei]
then by this and this time, it, it's going

00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,456 [Hwei]
to flow to the border to the

00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,515 [Hwei]
Netherlands," and things like this.

00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:05,696 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,956 [Hwei]
And so this is something that

00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:11,416 [Hwei]
when being used correctly can really

00:24:11,456 --> 00:24:12,616 [Hwei]
benefit maybe

00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:15,696 [Hwei]
the lives of a region of people. Like, I

00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:18,156 [Hwei]
don't know... I don't know the future

00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:20,755 [Hwei]
usage of this tool, but the implementation

00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:21,315 [Hwei]
of it,

00:24:21,976 --> 00:24:24,456 [Hwei]
the intention behind developing these kind

00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:24,995 [Hwei]
of tools,

00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:27,406 [Hwei]
uh-... to, to me-

00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:29,925 [Nicola]
So, in this project... Oh, sorry to

00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:31,076 [Nicola]
interrupt.

00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,836 [Hwei]
No. All good, all good. So this is one of

00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:36,456 [Hwei]
the, one of the examples of saying

00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:38,916 [Hwei]
some of the projects that I feel proud of.

00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:42,136 [Nicola]
Yeah, yeah, that, that, that makes sense.

00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:45,876 [Nicola]
Just, um, explain a bit, uh, the, the

00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:47,996 [Nicola]
difference between because that's where I

00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:50,656 [Nicola]
think it gets confusing for, for people.

00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:53,736 [Nicola]
For example, for this last project, is it,

00:24:53,836 --> 00:24:57,516 [Nicola]
um, generative AI? Is it deep learning?

00:24:57,536 --> 00:25:00,686 [Nicola]
It is traditional machine learning? Um-

00:25:00,756 --> 00:25:02,556 [Hwei]
Yeah, statistical machine learning.

00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:05,516 [Nicola]
Okay. What does it mean?

00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:07,276 [Hwei]
It is not even

00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:10,896 [Hwei]
the classical machine learning. Like we

00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:13,616 [Hwei]
just use statistics as the background

00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,676 [Hwei]
algorithm of it.

00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:18,356 [Nicola]
Okay. So-

00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,456 [Hwei]
No gen AI.

00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,176 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:21,296 [Hwei]
No deep learning,

00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:23,216 [Hwei]
no

00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:27,216 [Hwei]
neural networks, [laughs] not even random

00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:28,176 [Hwei]
forests.

00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:28,386 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:30,376 [Hwei]
It's just pure statistics.

00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:31,676 [Nicola]
Yeah. [laughs]

00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:33,806 [Hwei]
Oftentimes, this is just enough to solve

00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,476 [Hwei]
the problem reliably.

00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:38,016 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Because, uh, there is

00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:40,876 [Nicola]
maybe a tendency now to use

00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:44,416 [Nicola]
generative AI with these large language

00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:45,336 [Nicola]
models-

00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:45,386 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:48,196 [Nicola]
... for, um, to solve any kind of problems

00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:51,956 [Nicola]
or I... There is this, um, possibility at

00:25:52,076 --> 00:25:53,196 [Nicola]
least, right?

00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:53,536 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:54,836 [Nicola]
And, um, from

00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:58,956 [Nicola]
simple things like using ChatGPT as a, as

00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,936 [Nicola]
a consumer, as a user, and you are asking

00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:05,816 [Nicola]
it to, to translate apple to Italian-

00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:06,576 [Hwei]
Yeah

00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:08,736 [Nicola]
... and, and it's like using, um,

00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:10,276 [Nicola]
I don't know, a

00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:13,186 [Nicola]
atomic bomb to, to kill-

00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:13,336 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:14,926 [Nicola]
... a mosquito, right? I, I've heard-

00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:14,926 [Hwei]
Yeah

00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:16,256 [Nicola]
... someone saying that.

00:26:16,336 --> 00:26:16,606 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:19,836 [Nicola]
[laughs] Because we, we d- I mean, we

00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,506 [Nicola]
can think about it but, um, the normal

00:26:23,176 --> 00:26:25,996 [Nicola]
people using ChatGPT doesn't realize that

00:26:27,056 --> 00:26:29,376 [Nicola]
it's, it's a huge technology, right? And

00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,696 [Nicola]
there are data centers and, uh,

00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:35,906 [Nicola]
transformers and all i- incredible

00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:38,816 [Nicola]
technology behind it that transfer for

00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:42,256 [Nicola]
every simple, uh, conversation that you

00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:42,426 [Nicola]
have-

00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:42,446 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:44,476 [Nicola]
... with ChatGPT, right?

00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:44,606 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:45,296 [Nicola]
While for

00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:48,516 [Nicola]
many, many things, it's, it's not needed

00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:52,296 [Nicola]
that, that so intelligent

00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,276 [Nicola]
technology. You know what I mean?

00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:57,016 [Hwei]
Yeah, but I would say that's a big

00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:57,936 [Hwei]
distinction-

00:26:57,976 --> 00:26:58,085 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:02,576 [Hwei]
... between, um, between the predictive

00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:03,236 [Hwei]
modeling

00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:04,396 [Hwei]
models

00:27:04,996 --> 00:27:08,976 [Hwei]
with, uh, gen AI or LM models because

00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:11,276 [Hwei]
predictive modeling is largely

00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:14,616 [Hwei]
discriminative models. And then the LM,

00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:18,556 [Hwei]
like the things that, you know, ChatGPT or

00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:21,096 [Hwei]
whoever's coined the term, like AI-

00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:21,146 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:23,336 [Hwei]
... the big umbrella term, they are

00:27:23,396 --> 00:27:24,516 [Hwei]
largely generative.

00:27:25,116 --> 00:27:25,126 [Nicola]
Yeah.

00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:27,956 [Hwei]
And so they have different usage. So in,

00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,716 [Hwei]
in, in terms of, like, what you said,

00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,936 [Hwei]
you know, I, I want to do translation,

00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:34,776 [Hwei]
then a generative model can do that very

00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:37,896 [Hwei]
well because, um, you know, you can, you

00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:41,576 [Hwei]
can put, like, a, like a, you know, good

00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:44,376 [Hwei]
prom and then it's going to come up with

00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,656 [Hwei]
an equivalent version of, like, the

00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:50,256 [Hwei]
translation. But then in predictive

00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:53,636 [Hwei]
modeling projects, what it needs is

00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,416 [Hwei]
not creativity.

00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:55,936 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:27:55,946 --> 00:27:58,316 [Hwei]
What it needs is not generating new stuff

00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:01,936 [Hwei]
but to reliably, based on past data

00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:06,956 [Hwei]
points, to accurately predict things. So

00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:09,016 [Hwei]
if you take time series forecasting as an

00:28:09,076 --> 00:28:11,816 [Hwei]
example, um, maybe they have very sparse

00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:15,536 [Hwei]
data, they don't need a model,

00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:20,256 [Hwei]
like an LM, to tell, "Hey, can you help me

00:28:20,276 --> 00:28:22,516 [Hwei]
detect anomalies at which point

00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:25,336 [Hwei]
in time when this happens?" Because a

00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:27,816 [Hwei]
generative model is most likely to make

00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:29,296 [Hwei]
things up.

00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:30,116 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:28:30,156 --> 00:28:32,745 [Hwei]
But a predictive model, a discriminative

00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,836 [Hwei]
model, is going to train a model based on

00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:35,616 [Hwei]
the past data

00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:39,676 [Hwei]
and then if the quality's good and if the

00:28:39,736 --> 00:28:41,636 [Hwei]
model is... ha- has been trained

00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:43,625 [Hwei]
successfully, it can then

00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:48,236 [Hwei]
accurately predict, in time, uh, what

00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:50,326 [Hwei]
would be the... what would the anoli- amo-

00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:51,945 [Hwei]
no- [laughs] anomaly be.

00:28:51,956 --> 00:28:52,706 [Nicola]
Anomaly. Mm-hmm.

00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:53,536 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:53,606 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:55,816 [Hwei]
So they are for kinda, like, different

00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,156 [Hwei]
usage and that is why

00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:58,856 [Hwei]
I think

00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:03,416 [Hwei]
there are certain use cases for, um,

00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:07,876 [Hwei]
LMs. There are certain use cases that, um,

00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:10,656 [Hwei]
the discriminative machine learning

00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:12,896 [Hwei]
models or statistical models will still be

00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:15,516 [Hwei]
in, in demand because they are inherently

00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:17,556 [Hwei]
for different, different things.

00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:17,956 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:21,336 [Nicola]
What's the n- the current or, or next

00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:24,266 [Nicola]
thing that you would like to, to work on?

00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,816 [Nicola]
What's, what that excites you right now?

00:29:26,836 --> 00:29:29,356 [Nicola]
What are you, um, I don't know,

00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:31,096 [Nicola]
experimenting with for

00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,936 [Nicola]
a future client project or...

00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:38,546 [Hwei]
Um, I think right now I was too focused on

00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:41,856 [Hwei]
becoming a s- problem solver for worthy

00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:43,896 [Hwei]
problems. So-

00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:43,906 [Nicola]
Okay

00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:47,536 [Hwei]
... for every project that comes, um, it's

00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:52,536 [Hwei]
important for me to, to satisfy, like, to

00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:54,316 [Hwei]
be convinced of the for what and for

00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:58,266 [Hwei]
who. So, if you, if you come with me that

00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,476 [Hwei]
says, "Hey, we, we, we want

00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:04,286 [Hwei]
a water pollutant monitoring system-"

00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:04,496 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:07,956 [Hwei]
"... to do this and it's going to be used

00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:11,346 [Hwei]
by, uh, used by this and this person,"

00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:11,786 [Hwei]
if

00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:15,776 [Hwei]
I feel convinced of this, like, okay, like

00:30:16,156 --> 00:30:18,496 [Hwei]
goes, aligns with my values, I'm going to

00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:19,636 [Hwei]
say yes. Because

00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,936 [Hwei]
to me, based on my previous experience in

00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:26,436 [Hwei]
academia, in industry, I know where to

00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:30,866 [Hwei]
look for solutions. And so it's like right

00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,450 [Hwei]
now, the tools that I have a-...

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,230 [Hwei]
in my toolbox

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,920 [Hwei]
is machine learning,

00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,879 [Hwei]
deep learning, statistics,

00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,840 [Hwei]
LMs, AI engineering. And so for all of

00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:44,580 [Hwei]
those things paired with software

00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,640 [Hwei]
engineering, you can basically look for

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,230 [Hwei]
any solution. You can, you can come up

00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,840 [Hwei]
with any solutions. But what I think is,

00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,860 [Hwei]
um,

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,540 [Hwei]
it, as long as there's a worthy problem to

00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,000 [Hwei]
solve,

00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,520 [Hwei]
then it doesn't matter what does it take,

00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,280 [Hwei]
because every

00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,570 [Hwei]
freelance project that I'm taking on, it's

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,830 [Hwei]
just so different. And so-

00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:10,849 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:12,790 [Hwei]
... back to your question is kind of like,

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,400 [Hwei]
it doesn't matter what problem for me to

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,580 [Hwei]
solve, I know I have the toolbox. I, I

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,660 [Hwei]
have enough cards to pull out and-

00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,050 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,390 [Hwei]
... fundamentally, I know where to look

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,660 [Hwei]
for solutions. Um, and so for me right

00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,100 [Hwei]
now-

00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,430 [Nicola]
Yeah, I love it

00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,160 [Hwei]
... I, ri- right now, it's kind of like,

00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,420 [Hwei]
yeah, if a data science problem comes to

00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,180 [Hwei]
me, then great. If a

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,580 [Hwei]
predictive modeling plus LM, um, project

00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:41,160 [Hwei]
comes to me, then great. Um, I'm just

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,500 [Hwei]
looking for worthy problems to solve.

00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:44,760 [Nicola]
So

00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,639 [Nicola]
back to, to your beginning, now you know

00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,299 [Nicola]
how to make the magic happen.

00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:51,690 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,620 [Nicola]
So you're more focused on

00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,840 [Nicola]
make sure that it aligns with you, right?

00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,780 [Nicola]
Uh, you keep repeating this-

00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:58,900 [Hwei]
Hm

00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,660 [Nicola]
... for, for what and for, for who.

00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:02,820 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,820 [Nicola]
Uh, and so you, you, you

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,720 [Nicola]
just search for alignment there. That's

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,120 [Nicola]
the important part for you. And then you

00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,480 [Nicola]
know that you, you, you have so many tools

00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,000 [Nicola]
now, uh, that you can find af-

00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,420 [Nicola]
solution, right?

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,980 [Hwei]
Yeah, that's a very good-

00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,110 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,290 [Hwei]
... uh, depiction of where I'm going. Uh,

00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,960 [Hwei]
I'm also-

00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:23,990 [Nicola]
[clears throat]

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,900 [Hwei]
I'm also interested to, you know, like go

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,700 [Hwei]
back to

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,180 [Hwei]
my main expertise, which is computer

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,040 [Hwei]
vision. I feel like that is getting-

00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,070 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,540 [Hwei]
... so much less practice since I left,

00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,760 [Hwei]
uh, my master's degree.

00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,720 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:37,750 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,620 [Nicola]
So you would like to work on that again?

00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,860 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,660 [Hwei]
Yeah. It would be great. It's so fun.

00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:44,880 [Nicola]
Yeah.

00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,280 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,480 [Nicola]
Yeah, search for it, right? There are-

00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,869 [Hwei]
Yeah. [laughs]

00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:49,300 [Nicola]
[laughs]

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,020 [Hwei]
Just need some good portfolio items and

00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,740 [Hwei]
then I will start applying. [laughs]

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,889 [Nicola]
Cool. And, um, the, I guess the, the

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,100 [Nicola]
other, correct me if I'm wrong, the other

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,139 [Nicola]
big part for, for you, uh, I don't know if

00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,920 [Nicola]
it is half-half or, or different, is

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,260 [Nicola]
helping other people

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,500 [Nicola]
in their

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,630 [Nicola]
freelancing or-

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:13,730 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,450 [Nicola]
... business, uh, journey, right? How,

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:16,460 [Nicola]
how-

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,860 [Hwei]
Yeah, that's how we met. [laughs]

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,280 [Nicola]
Yeah, that's how we met. Yeah.

00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,800 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,100 [Nicola]
And, and yeah, you shared with me

00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,000 [Nicola]
many things with, about

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,110 [Nicola]
personal growth and

00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,160 [Nicola]
everything related to this kind of

00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,960 [Nicola]
journey, but how, how it started for you.

00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,440 [Nicola]
Uh,

00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,670 [Nicola]
when, when you-

00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,330 [Hwei]
For the coaching?

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,260 [Nicola]
... decided to... I guess before then

00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,029 [Nicola]
that, uh, from what, what I know about

00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,060 [Nicola]
your journey, when did you

00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:49,400 [Nicola]
started to have the desire, um, or

00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,740 [Nicola]
conviction to,

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,380 [Nicola]
uh, be a freelancer, be independent, uh,

00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,600 [Nicola]
something happened there?

00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,260 [Hwei]
Hm. So the first time that I, I

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,740 [Hwei]
dabble into freelancing was 2020. And at

00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,720 [Hwei]
that time,

00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,900 [Hwei]
so I... [laughs] Continue on the story,

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,159 [Hwei]
uh-

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:10,199 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,300 [Hwei]
... that we left off just now.

00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:11,760 [Nicola]
Uh-huh.

00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,630 [Hwei]
I, I started three years, uh, for my

00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,560 [Hwei]
master's-

00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:15,750 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,699 [Hwei]
... uh, in intelligent adaptive systems.

00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,300 [Hwei]
And afterwards I took on a full-time job

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,219 [Hwei]
as a data science consultant, which means

00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,179 [Hwei]
my company sent me to different

00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,920 [Hwei]
organizations and enterprises

00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,940 [Hwei]
across Germany to work on data science

00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,159 [Hwei]
projects, um, for those

00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,120 [Hwei]
companies. And afterwards, um, in 2020,

00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,020 [Hwei]
shortly before that, I feel

00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080 [Hwei]
like this doesn't align with me so much.

00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:48,020 [Hwei]
And so I quit. Um, and then I said, like,

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,279 [Hwei]
I, I really want to, you know, like try to

00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,320 [Hwei]
be, you know, establishing myself and

00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,920 [Hwei]
see, um,

00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,180 [Hwei]
how is it being self-employed. Um, and I

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,740 [Hwei]
tried that. Um, but at that time

00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,620 [Hwei]
I feel like

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,700 [Hwei]
it's also like,

00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,460 [Hwei]
how do you say? It's also like an

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,740 [Hwei]
opportunity come by,

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:09,900 [Hwei]
where

00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,180 [Hwei]
back in my master's time I was already

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,320 [Hwei]
interested in

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,180 [Hwei]
things to do with medical healthcare, with

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,040 [Hwei]
machine learning.

00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:19,500 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,400 [Hwei]
And in the middle of doing freelancing,

00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,060 [Hwei]
this PhD opportunity came to me. And so I

00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,779 [Hwei]
took on this PhD opportunity and working

00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,060 [Hwei]
that many hours, which means I have to, t-

00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,779 [Hwei]
uh, you know, like give up on

00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,800 [Hwei]
freelancing. Uh, but then

00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,140 [Hwei]
I only took on this, uh, research position

00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,060 [Hwei]
for two years, and then I decided to quit

00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,420 [Hwei]
again. So first freelancing experience is

00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,560 [Hwei]
in 2020. Like, it doesn't last very long.

00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,100 [Hwei]
I think at most, like half a year, one

00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,190 [Hwei]
year. And then I started properly, um,

00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:55,200 [Hwei]
after I end the contract on this research

00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,950 [Hwei]
position. Um,

00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,260 [Hwei]
and that was

00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,720 [Hwei]
maybe 2024. Uh,

00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,120 [Hwei]
wait.

00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,380 [Hwei]
2023? 2024. '03 or '04.

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,550 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,940 [Hwei]
So

00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,100 [Hwei]
I was being given a golden opportunity

00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,120 [Hwei]
again, because that time Dave just happens

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,860 [Hwei]
to open up this data freelancer program,

00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,140 [Hwei]
and then I had the privilege

00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,600 [Hwei]
to join the program, uh, in the first

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,300 [Hwei]
year. And I could still remember how

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,680 [Hwei]
much Dave and the community has helped me.

00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,040 [Hwei]
You know, in the first year it's a

00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,779 [Hwei]
smaller group and everybody is kind of

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,864 [Hwei]
like very close together. Um...... and

00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:41,924 [Hwei]
Dave is, like, hosting these Q&A calls

00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:46,654 [Hwei]
like he still does, um, today. And then I,

00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,824 [Hwei]
I started freelancing properly using what

00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:50,734 [Hwei]
was being taught in the program. Like, I

00:36:50,764 --> 00:36:51,284 [Hwei]
essentially

00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:56,964 [Hwei]
apply, tried to apply everything. Um, and

00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:59,104 [Hwei]
a year after that, I- I think

00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:01,084 [Hwei]
a year

00:37:02,484 --> 00:37:03,704 [Hwei]
after that, then

00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:06,484 [Hwei]
Dave just says, "Hey, we need a customer

00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:09,024 [Hwei]
success manager and coach." [laughs] "Um,

00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,244 [Hwei]
would you be interested to take on this

00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:14,684 [Hwei]
position?" And then I was, uh, I was just

00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:18,044 [Hwei]
being humbled by the trust that Dave, uh,

00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:20,964 [Hwei]
put on me. I feel like Dave, um, customer

00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,224 [Hwei]
success is not written anywhere on my

00:37:23,244 --> 00:37:25,174 [Hwei]
resume. [laughs] But

00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,724 [Hwei]
thanks for trusting me. It seems like a

00:37:27,804 --> 00:37:30,074 [Hwei]
very meaningful role to take on. I'm

00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:31,894 [Hwei]
willing to try. Like, let's, let's give it

00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:34,814 [Hwei]
a try. And now it's been, like, one and a

00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:37,004 [Hwei]
half years.

00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:40,204 [Nicola]
Okay. Yeah. Like, there is so much, I

00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:42,304 [Nicola]
feel, to unpack there.

00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:42,674 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:46,884 [Nicola]
Uh, when, when you started, uh,

00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:48,034 [Nicola]
freelancing and, and

00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:52,084 [Nicola]
y- you des- you, you felt that you needed

00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:52,584 [Nicola]
help,

00:37:53,824 --> 00:37:55,544 [Nicola]
uh, so you, you searched for-

00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:55,574 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:58,694 [Nicola]
... or you, you come across, uh, Dave, uh,

00:37:58,824 --> 00:38:00,444 [Nicola]
from, from YouTube, I guess.

00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:01,664 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:04,324 [Nicola]
And, and, and joined the program. What,

00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:08,064 [Nicola]
what was that, uh, you needed back then?

00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:09,784 [Hwei]
Hmm. So

00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:14,594 [Hwei]
when, when Dave's program came out, um...

00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:16,814 [Hwei]
I actually, before this... So in 2020 I

00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:18,934 [Hwei]
already joined some, like, freelancing

00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:22,144 [Hwei]
programs, but that one was more, like,

00:38:22,204 --> 00:38:23,724 [Hwei]
it's either general freelancing

00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:27,704 [Hwei]
or, like, a Python base. So, it's not

00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:29,544 [Hwei]
exactly like machine learning.

00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:29,654 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,144 [Hwei]
So when Dave's program is there, I know

00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,424 [Hwei]
that he's a data scientist and he's, um,

00:38:35,464 --> 00:38:37,784 [Hwei]
doing very successfully in freelancing as

00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:39,554 [Hwei]
a data scientist. And

00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,044 [Hwei]
his demeanor is just very, you know, down

00:38:43,064 --> 00:38:45,244 [Hwei]
to earth, as we know, and very smart. And

00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:49,104 [Hwei]
then I like that he walks the talk. Um,

00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:51,724 [Hwei]
that is the, the,

00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:54,524 [Hwei]
the, the decision where I decided to kind

00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:56,384 [Hwei]
of, like, reach out and express my

00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:59,904 [Hwei]
interest to join the program. Um, what I

00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:02,664 [Hwei]
think I needed at that time is

00:39:02,804 --> 00:39:05,344 [Hwei]
to,

00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,674 [Hwei]
is to essentially

00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:12,504 [Hwei]
see that I can do it

00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:17,204 [Hwei]
and I appreciate any kinds of guidance

00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:20,564 [Hwei]
that if, if anybody who has

00:39:21,564 --> 00:39:23,684 [Hwei]
w- walked the talk, like, walked this path

00:39:23,724 --> 00:39:26,984 [Hwei]
before, to see my blind spot, to give me

00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:27,884 [Hwei]
some advice

00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:32,504 [Hwei]
that I could apply for myself. Um, this is

00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:35,493 [Hwei]
why, like, this is mainly why, um, the

00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:37,304 [Hwei]
rel- the, the, the relevance

00:39:38,024 --> 00:39:39,224 [Hwei]
of the program itself

00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:40,904 [Hwei]
paired with

00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:42,444 [Hwei]
thinking that

00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:47,094 [Hwei]
I need some... I need somebody experienced

00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:49,864 [Hwei]
who was on this journey

00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:53,144 [Hwei]
doing very successfully and I can resonate

00:39:53,264 --> 00:39:53,564 [Hwei]
with-

00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:53,594 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:57,224 [Hwei]
... to help me to go through this process.

00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:00,424 [Nicola]
Yeah. Makes sense, right? And

00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:06,304 [Nicola]
wha- what are some, um, I guess, limiting

00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,464 [Nicola]
beliefs or something that you

00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:11,374 [Nicola]
personally struggled with during, during

00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:12,924 [Nicola]
that, that first year?

00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:14,153 [Hwei]
[laughs] I told-

00:40:14,153 --> 00:40:15,924 [Nicola]
There is something that comes to mind or

00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:16,144 [Nicola]
no?

00:40:16,184 --> 00:40:20,114 [Hwei]
[laughs] Yes. I told Dave, uh, in a later

00:40:20,244 --> 00:40:24,444 [Hwei]
interview, I said, uh, "Dave, I didn't

00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:26,064 [Hwei]
have confidence. I outsourced my

00:40:26,104 --> 00:40:28,044 [Hwei]
confidence to you, and thanks to you, I'm

00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:28,474 [Hwei]
here."

00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:28,493 [Nicola]
Yeah. [laughs]

00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:31,284 [Hwei]
"I'm in the game." [laughs]

00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:31,653 [Nicola]
I, I-

00:40:31,684 --> 00:40:31,993 [Hwei]
And then-

00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:34,204 [Nicola]
... I think you, you told me that phrase

00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,544 [Nicola]
the first time that we met. I wrote it

00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:36,864 [Nicola]
down.

00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:36,874 [Hwei]
Oh. [laughs]

00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:40,344 [Nicola]
And I [laughs], I, I always remembered it.

00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:41,464 [Nicola]
[laughs]

00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:42,653 [Hwei]
[laughs] Yeah, and I'm trying to do that

00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:43,304 [Hwei]
to all the-

00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:43,314 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:45,504 [Hwei]
... community members now. Like, I'm like,

00:40:46,304 --> 00:40:48,984 [Hwei]
"I know what you need, um, based on,

00:40:49,904 --> 00:40:51,544 [Hwei]
base- based on the fact that I'm also in

00:40:51,564 --> 00:40:52,124 [Hwei]
the game."

00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:53,444 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:40:53,544 --> 00:40:54,493 [Hwei]
Um,

00:40:55,564 --> 00:40:56,204 [Hwei]
and so

00:40:57,824 --> 00:41:02,044 [Hwei]
if you, if you can leave the rest to us

00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:04,044 [Hwei]
and then just say, "I want to go

00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:07,364 [Hwei]
here," we'll help you get there. And so in

00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,604 [Hwei]
a way-

00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:08,614 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:09,254 [Hwei]
... uh, I'm trying to

00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:12,464 [Hwei]
be outsourced, the confidence, [laughs] as

00:41:12,544 --> 00:41:14,254 [Hwei]
I, as I unknowingly outsource they've...

00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,494 [Hwei]
my confidence before. [laughs] Yeah.

00:41:17,494 --> 00:41:18,144 [Nicola]
[laughs]

00:41:18,163 --> 00:41:18,314 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:41:18,424 --> 00:41:21,534 [Nicola]
You're now passing on, right, to, to them,

00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:24,494 [Nicola]
to us, to, to the other r- rest of the

00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:26,864 [Nicola]
people in, in the community?

00:41:26,924 --> 00:41:28,684 [Hwei]
Yeah, but I also think it's my pleasure.

00:41:28,724 --> 00:41:28,864 [Hwei]
Like-

00:41:28,884 --> 00:41:28,894 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:41:28,894 --> 00:41:33,244 [Hwei]
... it, it, it is just such a pleasure to,

00:41:34,484 --> 00:41:37,324 [Hwei]
to witness everybody's journey because-

00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:37,413 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:40,024 [Hwei]
... oh, it's better than movies. It's

00:41:40,104 --> 00:41:43,184 [Hwei]
better than watching movies. [laughs]

00:41:43,254 --> 00:41:43,434 [Nicola]
It's real.

00:41:43,444 --> 00:41:44,964 [Hwei]
Like, look at your experience. Like, look

00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:47,384 [Hwei]
at your journey, like, um, from the first

00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,204 [Hwei]
time that we talk

00:41:49,124 --> 00:41:51,364 [Hwei]
and until today, you have grown a lot and

00:41:51,424 --> 00:41:53,484 [Hwei]
you have also achieved some things along

00:41:53,504 --> 00:41:54,004 [Hwei]
the way.

00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:54,564 [Nicola]
Yeah.

00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:57,384 [Hwei]
And so this takes, like, you know, you see

00:41:57,504 --> 00:42:00,024 [Hwei]
a real-life scenario in different people,

00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:01,984 [Hwei]
you see the stories in different people.

00:42:02,004 --> 00:42:02,244 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:42:02,344 --> 00:42:05,504 [Hwei]
Um, I think,

00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:09,844 [Hwei]
I think my role is just to remind

00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:10,904 [Hwei]
everybody

00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:15,464 [Hwei]
what they know already within themself. I

00:42:15,564 --> 00:42:19,353 [Hwei]
just reinforce that, "Nicola, based on

00:42:19,384 --> 00:42:21,184 [Hwei]
what we talk, I think you are this and

00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:25,764 [Hwei]
this person." Um, "If this is your goal,

00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:29,353 [Hwei]
I help you hold, uh, the... your, your

00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,244 [Hwei]
ideal self in my mind, and in my mind,

00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:35,104 [Hwei]
every goal that you told me that you're

00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:37,663 [Hwei]
going to achieve, I consider it, I

00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:41,044 [Hwei]
consider it done already. And now I'm just

00:42:41,104 --> 00:42:43,972 [Hwei]
walking this process with you."... e- but

00:42:44,032 --> 00:42:45,772 [Hwei]
in my mind, it's already done, and I'm

00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:45,992 [Hwei]
just-

00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:46,002 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:47,522 [Hwei]
... waiting for one day in the future

00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:49,992 [Hwei]
that you'll come back to tell me that yes,

00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:52,572 [Hwei]
"Hui, I'm already in my ideal self." And,

00:42:52,592 --> 00:42:54,232 [Hwei]
a- and I'll be just like, "Yeah, I knew

00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:57,152 [Hwei]
it. I knew it a long time ago." [laughs]

00:42:57,162 --> 00:42:59,492 [Nicola]
[laughs] Yeah. Yeah, that, that makes

00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:01,402 [Nicola]
sense. But, um,

00:43:02,932 --> 00:43:05,452 [Nicola]
what... now that you have seen people

00:43:05,512 --> 00:43:07,792 [Nicola]
going, going through this, what, what are

00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:11,142 [Nicola]
the skills to be coachable?

00:43:12,612 --> 00:43:14,472 [Hwei]
What are the skills to be coachable? Wow,

00:43:14,532 --> 00:43:16,192 [Hwei]
that's such a great question. Let me

00:43:16,232 --> 00:43:18,312 [Hwei]
think.

00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:22,112 [Hwei]
I think it's mostly

00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,552 [Hwei]
the humility-

00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:24,562 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:24,562 [Hwei]
...

00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,032 [Hwei]
to see a different

00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:30,392 [Hwei]
perspective of the story.

00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:34,392 [Nicola]
What do you mean?

00:43:34,532 --> 00:43:36,432 [Hwei]
A lot of people,

00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:38,932 [Hwei]
um... so

00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:43,462 [Hwei]
in my experience, I feel that

00:43:44,512 --> 00:43:46,432 [Hwei]
I cannot help those people

00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:52,132 [Hwei]
who cannot believe in another

00:43:53,852 --> 00:43:56,392 [Hwei]
version of narration. So

00:43:57,632 --> 00:43:58,712 [Hwei]
what they want is,

00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:01,592 [Hwei]
"I'm stuck here.

00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:05,222 [Hwei]
Don't convince me otherwise." And then

00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:08,972 [Hwei]
they try to... they're not receptive

00:44:10,332 --> 00:44:13,352 [Hwei]
to the other things. So I would say, first

00:44:13,412 --> 00:44:15,512 [Hwei]
of all, the humility to accept that

00:44:16,372 --> 00:44:18,072 [Hwei]
reality has different narration,

00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:24,652 [Hwei]
and you just have to... other- rather than

00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:25,712 [Hwei]
seeing it as

00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:26,672 [Hwei]
good or bad,

00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,332 [Hwei]
see it as pros and cons. And then see

00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:33,652 [Hwei]
yourself as one avatar in the sandbox,

00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:36,872 [Hwei]
and says, "I'm here. This is where I want

00:44:36,912 --> 00:44:40,202 [Hwei]
to go. What is beneficial for me to take?"

00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:43,452 [Hwei]
And people with narrate, a certain

00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,612 [Hwei]
narration, they are very s- you know, very

00:44:45,652 --> 00:44:46,752 [Hwei]
convinced of something-

00:44:46,772 --> 00:44:47,532 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:50,912 [Hwei]
... when I see that it, this convincing

00:44:50,932 --> 00:44:51,541 [Hwei]
reality

00:44:52,592 --> 00:44:56,192 [Hwei]
does not serve them, uh, and if they,

00:44:57,032 --> 00:44:58,272 [Hwei]
if they are not ready

00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:00,312 [Hwei]
to accept

00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:03,672 [Hwei]
other possibilities, other narration that

00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:05,782 [Hwei]
says, "Hey, maybe you can look into here

00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,292 [Hwei]
and that," um,

00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:12,272 [Hwei]
I, I think if they are very... if, if they

00:45:12,392 --> 00:45:14,332 [Hwei]
decide to stay in this narration, there's

00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:16,092 [Hwei]
nothing that I can do.

00:45:16,492 --> 00:45:17,652 [Nicola]
I see.

00:45:17,752 --> 00:45:17,892 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:18,302 [Nicola]
So, and during-

00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:20,952 [Hwei]
Also, this is one. Second would be

00:45:20,992 --> 00:45:22,932 [Hwei]
accountability.

00:45:22,972 --> 00:45:23,672 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:45:23,692 --> 00:45:25,152 [Hwei]
This is what we do every week, Nicolas.

00:45:25,652 --> 00:45:27,041 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:29,792 [Nicola]
[laughs] I know that part well.

00:45:29,972 --> 00:45:32,022 [Hwei]
[laughs] Yeah.

00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:32,552 [Nicola]
Okay. But-

00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:34,452 [Hwei]
Accountability. Do they follow up?

00:45:34,472 --> 00:45:34,502 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:45:34,502 --> 00:45:36,261 [Hwei]
Do they follow through, um,

00:45:37,592 --> 00:45:40,652 [Hwei]
with, with the things that they should be

00:45:40,692 --> 00:45:43,272 [Hwei]
doing, they said they would do?

00:45:43,332 --> 00:45:44,492 [Nicola]
Yeah. So-

00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:47,072 [Hwei]
Because action moves the needle, right?

00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:48,712 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:50,032 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,432 [Nicola]
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. I, I was

00:45:51,472 --> 00:45:52,312 [Nicola]
curious to, to

00:45:52,952 --> 00:45:55,252 [Nicola]
dig a bit deeper on, on the first part

00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:58,052 [Nicola]
that you... uh, what you said, right?

00:45:58,112 --> 00:45:58,422 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,652 [Nicola]
So I'm hearing that if someone

00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:01,472 [Nicola]
has

00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:05,972 [Nicola]
their own narration, es-

00:46:05,982 --> 00:46:06,101 [Hwei]
Hmm

00:46:06,152 --> 00:46:08,372 [Nicola]
... so it, like a story that they tell

00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:09,012 [Nicola]
themself

00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:10,582 [Nicola]
and they,

00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,452 [Nicola]
they are not willing to

00:46:14,512 --> 00:46:15,712 [Nicola]
see another story-

00:46:16,632 --> 00:46:16,772 [Hwei]
Hmm

00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:20,912 [Nicola]
... but they want to g- to get somewhere,

00:46:20,932 --> 00:46:24,332 [Nicola]
uh, to their goals. And y- you, you help

00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:26,912 [Nicola]
them s- realize that, uh,

00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:31,292 [Nicola]
to get there, they need to, to change, um,

00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:32,252 [Nicola]
the narration,

00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:34,732 [Nicola]
right? So if they-

00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:35,382 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,532 [Nicola]
... are not flexible in that way or they

00:46:37,572 --> 00:46:37,852 [Nicola]
don't

00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:42,652 [Nicola]
l- listen that there is another, um, uh,

00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:45,352 [Nicola]
narration, there is another story that

00:46:45,432 --> 00:46:48,432 [Nicola]
serves you better to, to get there-

00:46:48,532 --> 00:46:48,832 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:46:50,912 --> 00:46:52,332 [Nicola]
... um, it's difficult to, to help

00:46:52,952 --> 00:46:55,312 [Nicola]
someone stuck in that situation. Is that

00:46:55,352 --> 00:46:57,312 [Nicola]
what, what you mean?

00:46:57,412 --> 00:46:58,752 [Hwei]
Yeah. So-

00:46:58,762 --> 00:46:58,762 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:46:58,762 --> 00:47:01,832 [Hwei]
... if they, i- if they feel that it is

00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:02,652 [Hwei]
more,

00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:06,952 [Hwei]
it is more valuable to hold onto the

00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:11,012 [Hwei]
current narration that put them in current

00:47:11,052 --> 00:47:11,712 [Hwei]
situation

00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:15,152 [Hwei]
and they are not ready to

00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:19,432 [Hwei]
see elsewhere. You know, like even to be

00:47:19,512 --> 00:47:21,392 [Hwei]
open for the possibility, the other

00:47:21,532 --> 00:47:22,192 [Hwei]
narration of

00:47:22,892 --> 00:47:24,592 [Hwei]
maybe there's some other things that you

00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:26,832 [Hwei]
can still try or maybe there is some

00:47:27,432 --> 00:47:30,432 [Hwei]
interpretation of your assumptions, uh,

00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,732 [Hwei]
that you can maybe tweak a little bit.

00:47:32,772 --> 00:47:36,352 [Hwei]
Maybe, maybe that, that can be... that can

00:47:36,412 --> 00:47:39,632 [Hwei]
move you forward a little bit. So, um,

00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:44,132 [Hwei]
yeah. So if, if they,

00:47:45,052 --> 00:47:48,032 [Hwei]
if they feel more secure by holding onto

00:47:48,092 --> 00:47:50,032 [Hwei]
this,

00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:53,252 [Hwei]
this narration-

00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:53,572 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:56,242 [Hwei]
... um, I will honor that. I will make

00:47:56,352 --> 00:47:58,392 [Hwei]
space. I- I will make space for that as

00:47:58,432 --> 00:48:00,872 [Hwei]
well to say that, "It's okay. I can see

00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:05,162 [Hwei]
that you're not ready to, to, to

00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:08,982 [Hwei]
explore or this narration, um, uh, at this

00:48:09,092 --> 00:48:11,752 [Hwei]
moment." And so, um,

00:48:13,252 --> 00:48:14,772 [Hwei]
I, I, I feel that

00:48:15,452 --> 00:48:17,461 [Hwei]
it is also important to

00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:22,092 [Hwei]
make them feel okay that this narration

00:48:22,172 --> 00:48:23,222 [Hwei]
right now that

00:48:24,452 --> 00:48:27,012 [Hwei]
they, they ho- like, they hug, like

00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:29,172 [Hwei]
hugging a log just to not drown-

00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:29,302 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:48:29,302 --> 00:48:31,892 [Hwei]
... um, it's okay to

00:48:32,772 --> 00:48:35,152 [Hwei]
acknowledge that and give space

00:48:35,852 --> 00:48:36,892 [Hwei]
for them to

00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:41,332 [Hwei]
do this until they are ready again.

00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:44,612 [Nicola]
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I recognize

00:48:44,772 --> 00:48:51,044 [Nicola]
your... y- you have this, um...... way of

00:48:51,064 --> 00:48:51,484 [Nicola]
helping

00:48:51,584 --> 00:48:55,404 [Nicola]
people. Uh, yeah, that is, uh, you know,

00:48:55,444 --> 00:48:57,864 [Nicola]
everyone has their own, um,

00:48:59,344 --> 00:49:00,384 [Nicola]
way of going to

00:49:01,544 --> 00:49:04,024 [Nicola]
coach someone in, in these situations,

00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:04,314 [Nicola]
right?

00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:05,154 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:49:05,154 --> 00:49:07,644 [Nicola]
Uh, there are some more, um, I don't know

00:49:07,684 --> 00:49:10,734 [Nicola]
how to call it, more strict in a way, uh,

00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:12,624 [Nicola]
but y- you can

00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:15,924 [Nicola]
go and, and

00:49:16,764 --> 00:49:18,644 [Nicola]
take someone from where they are,

00:49:20,064 --> 00:49:22,483 [Nicola]
uh, as you've said, acknowledge that they,

00:49:22,644 --> 00:49:25,464 [Nicola]
in this moment, they might need something

00:49:25,564 --> 00:49:29,044 [Nicola]
else, right, that you cannot force them,

00:49:29,144 --> 00:49:29,334 [Nicola]
uh,

00:49:29,944 --> 00:49:33,644 [Nicola]
right? That is a more gradual journey-

00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:34,294 [Hwei]
Hmm

00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:36,864 [Nicola]
... uh, that comes with, with whatever

00:49:36,904 --> 00:49:38,924 [Nicola]
time and type of journey-

00:49:38,944 --> 00:49:39,204 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:49:39,264 --> 00:49:41,364 [Nicola]
... uh, someone needs, right? [laughs]

00:49:41,384 --> 00:49:42,964 [Hwei]
Have you heard about the story of the

00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:44,784 [Hwei]
mushroom man?

00:49:44,904 --> 00:49:46,724 [Nicola]
Mushroom... No.

00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:50,664 [Hwei]
Okay. So, um-

00:49:50,673 --> 00:49:50,673 [Nicola]
Tell me.

00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:52,924 [Hwei]
I watched this story from the internet, so

00:49:52,944 --> 00:49:55,184 [Hwei]
I don't know where to cite this from, but

00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:55,704 [Hwei]
this story's-

00:49:55,844 --> 00:49:55,864 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:49:55,874 --> 00:49:57,464 [Hwei]
... stuck with my head. And-

00:49:57,484 --> 00:49:57,654 [Nicola]
Hmm

00:49:57,664 --> 00:49:59,664 [Hwei]
... I've been sl- I've been secretly

00:49:59,744 --> 00:50:01,924 [Hwei]
applying to all of you guys [laughs] all

00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:02,104 [Hwei]
along.

00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:04,004 [Nicola]
Oh. Let's see.

00:50:04,064 --> 00:50:08,084 [Hwei]
So, [laughs] so the mushroom man is,

00:50:08,124 --> 00:50:11,644 [Hwei]
hmm, there's a guy who is so convinced

00:50:11,684 --> 00:50:14,014 [Hwei]
that he is a mushroom, he's not a m-

00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:14,884 [Hwei]
human.

00:50:14,904 --> 00:50:15,004 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:50:15,024 --> 00:50:17,304 [Hwei]
So, [laughs], a guy is so convinced-

00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:17,314 [Nicola]
[laughs]

00:50:17,324 --> 00:50:19,504 [Hwei]
... that he's a mushroom, and so he just

00:50:19,544 --> 00:50:21,684 [Hwei]
take this umbrella and then just stood on

00:50:21,804 --> 00:50:24,584 [Hwei]
one side all along. Like, he just wants to

00:50:24,644 --> 00:50:26,374 [Hwei]
be a mushroom. Like, he's so-

00:50:26,374 --> 00:50:26,374 [Nicola]
Okay

00:50:26,374 --> 00:50:28,124 [Hwei]
... convinced that he is a mushroom.

00:50:28,144 --> 00:50:28,154 [Nicola]
Believe me, this.

00:50:28,164 --> 00:50:30,644 [Hwei]
Yeah. [laughs] And then, of course,

00:50:31,244 --> 00:50:33,744 [Hwei]
other people who care for him will say

00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:34,984 [Hwei]
like, "You're not a mushroom. You're

00:50:35,024 --> 00:50:36,534 [Hwei]
human." Like, "Come on." [laughs] It's

00:50:36,644 --> 00:50:37,454 [Hwei]
like-

00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:37,454 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:38,824 [Hwei]
..."Look at yourself. You don't look like

00:50:38,924 --> 00:50:41,484 [Hwei]
a mushroom," but that guy is just so

00:50:41,524 --> 00:50:43,684 [Hwei]
convinced to be a mushroom and nobody can

00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:45,534 [Hwei]
change his mind. Um,

00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:48,504 [Hwei]
and so one day, a person comes along

00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:52,124 [Hwei]
and [sighs] he just take another umbrella

00:50:52,224 --> 00:50:53,804 [Hwei]
and just sit next to him.

00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:54,644 [Nicola]
Uh-huh.

00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,164 [Hwei]
And then that mushroom guy said,

00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,504 [Hwei]
"Hey, what are you doing here?" And then

00:50:59,544 --> 00:51:00,644 [Hwei]
that guy just says like,

00:51:01,404 --> 00:51:04,344 [Hwei]
"I'm also a mushroom." [laughs]

00:51:04,984 --> 00:51:07,984 [Hwei]
And then that guy says, "Huh. Oh, we're

00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:09,514 [Hwei]
mushroom friends now."

00:51:09,514 --> 00:51:09,514 [Nicola]
[laughs]

00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,624 [Hwei]
And after, you know, sitting, sitting with

00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:16,064 [Hwei]
that guy for, for some time, that, that

00:51:16,124 --> 00:51:18,544 [Hwei]
guy just started to stand and

00:51:18,584 --> 00:51:21,504 [Hwei]
walk. And then the mushroom man just

00:51:21,544 --> 00:51:23,564 [Hwei]
freaked out. And then [laughs] that

00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:26,104 [Hwei]
mushroom is like, "Hey, you're a mushroom.

00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:28,764 [Hwei]
How can you do this?" And then that guy

00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:31,384 [Hwei]
just said, "You don't know? It's 2025.

00:51:31,424 --> 00:51:32,884 [Hwei]
Mushrooms can walk."

00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:34,213 [Nicola]
[sniffs]

00:51:34,244 --> 00:51:37,764 [Hwei]
And then that guy says, "Huh. Interesting.

00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:40,514 [Hwei]
Are you... Okay? Mushrooms can walk?" And

00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:42,314 [Hwei]
he's like, "Of course. All mushrooms can

00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:45,204 [Hwei]
walk this year, starting this year." And

00:51:45,224 --> 00:51:46,544 [Hwei]
then the mushroom guy just stand up and

00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:52,304 [Hwei]
walked. And so the moral of the story is,

00:51:52,424 --> 00:51:52,844 [Hwei]
um,

00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,224 [Hwei]
righteousness is not my goal

00:51:57,884 --> 00:51:59,144 [Hwei]
in coaching.

00:51:59,154 --> 00:51:59,154 [Nicola]
Hmm.

00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:03,374 [Hwei]
Um, the intention to making somebody, um,

00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:05,474 [Hwei]
seeing the potential in somebody, that

00:52:05,504 --> 00:52:08,044 [Hwei]
this person is not a mushroom, is a human,

00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:11,204 [Hwei]
and he has the place that he needs to go.

00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:14,784 [Hwei]
Um, I don't have to be right. I just have

00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:15,164 [Hwei]
to

00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:16,584 [Hwei]
try my best

00:52:17,404 --> 00:52:20,744 [Hwei]
to have the intention to get this person

00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:21,284 [Hwei]
into where

00:52:21,924 --> 00:52:23,884 [Hwei]
they want to go.

00:52:23,984 --> 00:52:26,724 [Nicola]
Yeah. Now, it, it makes... Yeah,

00:52:26,804 --> 00:52:28,844 [Nicola]
definitely, it's how you're helping us. It

00:52:28,904 --> 00:52:30,824 [Nicola]
makes sense. [laughs]

00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,524 [Hwei]
[laughs] Now you know my trick. [laughs]

00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:35,864 [Nicola]
Yeah. [laughs] No, this is great. Yeah,

00:52:35,884 --> 00:52:38,904 [Nicola]
and I, I mean, it's... These stories help

00:52:38,964 --> 00:52:39,304 [Nicola]
you to

00:52:40,204 --> 00:52:42,264 [Nicola]
fix, uh, fix some, some ideas, but, you

00:52:42,344 --> 00:52:46,444 [Nicola]
know, I, I, I see, uh, you know, where,

00:52:46,484 --> 00:52:47,174 [Nicola]
where...

00:52:48,964 --> 00:52:50,754 [Nicola]
from where you, you come from, and, uh,

00:52:52,484 --> 00:52:55,044 [Nicola]
different people need different things.

00:52:55,104 --> 00:52:55,434 [Nicola]
Someone

00:52:56,064 --> 00:52:57,364 [Nicola]
works better with a

00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:01,044 [Nicola]
carrot and stick approach, and, uh-

00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:01,134 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:53:01,134 --> 00:53:03,144 [Nicola]
... someone who... It's, it's a mush-

00:53:03,204 --> 00:53:05,464 [Nicola]
someone is a mushroom. [laughs] They need

00:53:05,524 --> 00:53:07,803 [Nicola]
a different approach to this. Uh, yeah,

00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:09,933 [Nicola]
that, yeah, I can relate to that. It

00:53:09,984 --> 00:53:11,594 [Nicola]
makes, makes sense. And, uh-

00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:13,124 [Hwei]
Yeah, it just happen that I don't have to

00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:13,944 [Hwei]
be right.

00:53:13,954 --> 00:53:13,954 [Nicola]
Yeah.

00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:16,294 [Hwei]
I don't have to, I don't need to have

00:53:16,324 --> 00:53:18,804 [Hwei]
another people told me that I'm right

00:53:19,724 --> 00:53:22,044 [Hwei]
for me to feel good about myself. Like, I

00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:24,994 [Hwei]
just, like, I care about another person,

00:53:25,044 --> 00:53:27,524 [Hwei]
and for this care, uh, I would do my best.

00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:30,174 [Hwei]
I know, I know my goal. That my goal is

00:53:30,204 --> 00:53:31,464 [Hwei]
not to be right.

00:53:31,524 --> 00:53:34,544 [Nicola]
Hmm. Mm-hmm. Is to, to get someone

00:53:35,164 --> 00:53:36,644 [Nicola]
where they want to go. Yeah.

00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:39,604 [Nicola]
Okay, cool. So that's, that's-

00:53:39,614 --> 00:53:39,614 [Hwei]
[clears throat]

00:53:39,614 --> 00:53:41,964 [Nicola]
... let's say, the first, uh, skill that,

00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:44,944 [Nicola]
that, that you mentioned. The second

00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:48,084 [Nicola]
important one is accountability, right?

00:53:48,104 --> 00:53:48,264 [Hwei]
Hmm.

00:53:48,284 --> 00:53:49,444 [Nicola]
And, and so why

00:53:50,304 --> 00:53:50,844 [Nicola]
some of us

00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:53,724 [Nicola]
ask everyone

00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,884 [Nicola]
[laughs] some- sometimes we, we are not

00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:57,504 [Nicola]
able to

00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:02,904 [Nicola]
do what we say that, uh, we want to do.

00:54:02,944 --> 00:54:03,864 [Nicola]
Why we need that

00:54:03,964 --> 00:54:05,844 [Nicola]
accountability?

00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:08,824 [Hwei]
Accountability

00:54:10,004 --> 00:54:12,504 [Hwei]
helps you make progress. And there can be

00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:16,474 [Hwei]
many reasons why, mm, you cannot do

00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:19,444 [Hwei]
what you wanted to do. You might be

00:54:19,644 --> 00:54:20,114 [Hwei]
lacking

00:54:21,244 --> 00:54:24,204 [Hwei]
skills. You might be lacking some tools.

00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:27,174 [Hwei]
You might be lacking the permission that

00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:29,314 [Hwei]
only you can give to yourself. And another

00:54:29,344 --> 00:54:32,354 [Hwei]
people just have to remind you that, um,

00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:36,644 [Hwei]
the power is not outside. The power is

00:54:36,704 --> 00:54:37,704 [Hwei]
inside.

00:54:37,764 --> 00:54:38,784 [Nicola]
Hmm.

00:54:38,844 --> 00:54:41,044 [Hwei]
And these are the things that

00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:44,324 [Hwei]
I think in life we just rely on the

00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:45,784 [Hwei]
kindness of another person

00:54:46,504 --> 00:54:48,304 [Hwei]
to help you move forward, and that is how

00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:48,814 [Hwei]
we,

00:54:50,344 --> 00:54:52,284 [Hwei]
that is how we choose to interact with the

00:54:52,364 --> 00:54:56,392 [Hwei]
world, to...To be willing to accept the

00:54:56,492 --> 00:55:00,312 [Hwei]
goodness from other people, and then pass

00:55:00,372 --> 00:55:03,172 [Hwei]
it forward.

00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:04,932 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:55:05,752 --> 00:55:06,262 [Nicola]
[sniffs] Okay.

00:55:07,112 --> 00:55:09,912 [Nicola]
Yeah, you know, I was, I was expecting a

00:55:10,032 --> 00:55:11,562 [Nicola]
totally different, uh-

00:55:11,572 --> 00:55:12,512 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:55:12,572 --> 00:55:14,092 [Nicola]
... totally different answer, and I'm

00:55:14,152 --> 00:55:15,532 [Nicola]
realizing, yeah, that

00:55:16,852 --> 00:55:19,172 [Nicola]
I don't know, in the couple last days,

00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:22,212 [Nicola]
and now I'm connecting random dots.

00:55:22,312 --> 00:55:22,352 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:23,082 [Nicola]
Uh,

00:55:23,932 --> 00:55:25,012 [Nicola]
[laughs] excuse me if it doesn't make

00:55:25,052 --> 00:55:28,192 [Nicola]
sense. But no, I think it makes some sense

00:55:28,272 --> 00:55:30,642 [Nicola]
because they're... When I think about

00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:34,032 [Nicola]
accountability or these kind of topics,

00:55:34,132 --> 00:55:37,272 [Nicola]
uh, coaching and, and people going through

00:55:37,592 --> 00:55:40,892 [Nicola]
some personal development journey, I feel

00:55:40,992 --> 00:55:41,082 [Nicola]
the

00:55:43,232 --> 00:55:46,212 [Nicola]
predominant narrative online, especially

00:55:46,532 --> 00:55:47,212 [Nicola]
YouTube or

00:55:47,872 --> 00:55:51,132 [Nicola]
the, the influences that I see, thanks to

00:55:51,172 --> 00:55:54,192 [Nicola]
the algorithm, algorithm of whatever, are

00:55:55,072 --> 00:55:58,092 [Nicola]
quite strong, right? You know, more

00:55:58,352 --> 00:56:00,712 [Nicola]
masculine energy in a way.

00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,052 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:03,152 [Nicola]
The Tony Robbins or

00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:07,832 [Nicola]
this kind of motivational stuff, right?

00:56:07,852 --> 00:56:08,692 [Nicola]
Makes sense?

00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:09,892 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:14,612 [Nicola]
While in, in your answer, I feel

00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:17,162 [Nicola]
definitely a different energy, uh-

00:56:17,162 --> 00:56:17,162 [Hwei]
Okay

00:56:17,162 --> 00:56:19,852 [Nicola]
... that is not the predominant one

00:56:19,972 --> 00:56:22,272 [Nicola]
because predominant is louder and

00:56:22,332 --> 00:56:22,752 [Nicola]
definitely

00:56:24,232 --> 00:56:27,032 [Nicola]
more masculine. I, I feel there-

00:56:27,072 --> 00:56:27,332 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

00:56:28,012 --> 00:56:30,292 [Nicola]
... at least, uh, yeah, as I said, what,

00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:32,572 [Nicola]
what we see online, et cetera, is more

00:56:33,532 --> 00:56:36,332 [Nicola]
men doing this, at least, uh, what, what I

00:56:36,372 --> 00:56:36,952 [Nicola]
receive from

00:56:37,652 --> 00:56:39,772 [Nicola]
the algorithm. And while

00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:43,252 [Nicola]
the, your angle is, is, is different in

00:56:43,772 --> 00:56:44,072 [Nicola]
this-

00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:44,842 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:56:44,852 --> 00:56:47,452 [Nicola]
Yeah. And it's, it's a, it's good that

00:56:47,512 --> 00:56:49,212 [Nicola]
there is another angle, right?

00:56:49,252 --> 00:56:49,932 [Hwei]
Yeah.

00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:52,732 [Nicola]
And that we normally don't, don't see.

00:56:52,752 --> 00:56:52,912 [Nicola]
What do you think?

00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:54,752 [Hwei]
Yeah, I'm glad that I contribute a little

00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:55,942 [Hwei]
bit to that. Uh-

00:56:55,952 --> 00:56:56,162 [Nicola]
Yeah

00:56:56,532 --> 00:56:58,972 [Hwei]
... but I also see that, um,

00:56:59,692 --> 00:57:02,292 [Hwei]
I think you just have to look, um-

00:57:02,302 --> 00:57:02,302 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:57:02,302 --> 00:57:04,252 [Hwei]
... advice like this also exists on the

00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:05,112 [Hwei]
internet.

00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:05,352 [Nicola]
Yeah.

00:57:05,372 --> 00:57:05,481 [Hwei]
Um,

00:57:06,332 --> 00:57:07,241 [Hwei]
I think it's more like,

00:57:08,052 --> 00:57:10,392 [Hwei]
if, if you don't realize, like, you just

00:57:10,432 --> 00:57:11,752 [Hwei]
don't know what you don't know. I think,

00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:14,212 [Hwei]
and this happens with a lot of people, and

00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:15,512 [Hwei]
especially the, the design of the

00:57:15,572 --> 00:57:17,412 [Hwei]
algorithm is more like bubble-like.

00:57:17,492 --> 00:57:17,732 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:20,312 [Hwei]
Like, you get more of what you look at and

00:57:20,372 --> 00:57:23,112 [Hwei]
what you consume. And so you, you know,

00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:24,612 [Hwei]
from time to time, look, look the other

00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:25,492 [Hwei]
side. [laughs]

00:57:25,592 --> 00:57:27,992 [Nicola]
Yeah. [laughs] You have some

00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:30,112 [Nicola]
recommendation for the other side? What,

00:57:30,172 --> 00:57:31,222 [Nicola]
what, what are some

00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,232 [Nicola]
resources or some people that influenced

00:57:34,332 --> 00:57:34,412 [Nicola]
you?

00:57:35,712 --> 00:57:40,032 [Hwei]
Oh, resources and people. Um,

00:57:42,452 --> 00:57:44,292 [Hwei]
I don't know, where do I start? [laughs]

00:57:44,372 --> 00:57:47,092 [Hwei]
It's like in the, in, in which topic?

00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:50,172 [Nicola]
Yeah, in this kind of, uh, I think now we

00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:50,692 [Nicola]
are in the

00:57:51,372 --> 00:57:52,872 [Nicola]
personal development

00:57:53,812 --> 00:57:54,472 [Nicola]
or, um,

00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,792 [Nicola]
doing something that you have never done

00:57:57,852 --> 00:57:58,892 [Nicola]
before.

00:57:58,912 --> 00:57:58,942 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:57:58,952 --> 00:58:01,692 [Nicola]
In this case, it's, uh, your business,

00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:03,432 [Nicola]
your freelance journey.

00:58:03,452 --> 00:58:03,732 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:05,492 [Nicola]
And so there is that struggle to do

00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:06,192 [Nicola]
something that

00:58:07,312 --> 00:58:09,672 [Nicola]
you have not done before. And so you might

00:58:09,732 --> 00:58:10,012 [Nicola]
need

00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:12,892 [Nicola]
what we are talking about, right? Changing

00:58:12,932 --> 00:58:15,592 [Nicola]
your story, uh, accountability, someone

00:58:15,612 --> 00:58:17,132 [Nicola]
that helps you.

00:58:17,152 --> 00:58:18,152 [Hwei]
Hmm.

00:58:18,212 --> 00:58:19,492 [Nicola]
So, in this realm of

00:58:20,712 --> 00:58:22,672 [Nicola]
personal growth,

00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:26,652 [Nicola]
what, um, most influenced you or you like

00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:27,912 [Nicola]
to read,

00:58:28,712 --> 00:58:29,392 [Nicola]
look up to-

00:58:29,612 --> 00:58:29,622 [Hwei]
[laughs]

00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:30,772 [Nicola]
... go back to?

00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:35,712 [Hwei]
I am currently reading... So, go back to,

00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:39,072 [Hwei]
I have one principle book that help me,

00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:42,662 [Hwei]
like that is the guiding light, uh, of, of

00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:43,812 [Hwei]
my life.

00:58:43,832 --> 00:58:43,842 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:46,542 [Hwei]
And then some supplementary books. And,

00:58:46,592 --> 00:58:51,352 [Hwei]
um, but yeah, I can share them. So,

00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:55,072 [Hwei]
my guiding principle resource

00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:59,452 [Hwei]
is, uh, Diamond Sutra by the Buddha.

00:58:59,462 --> 00:58:59,462 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:58:59,462 --> 00:59:02,652 [Hwei]
And then I am currently reading,

00:59:03,592 --> 00:59:06,592 [Hwei]
I'm currently reading Tao Te Ching by Lao

00:59:06,612 --> 00:59:07,952 [Hwei]
Tzu.

00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:07,962 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:59:08,072 --> 00:59:10,412 [Hwei]
Um, but they are very meta, they're very,

00:59:11,912 --> 00:59:13,592 [Hwei]
they're very like [laughs] they are for

00:59:13,652 --> 00:59:15,252 [Hwei]
people like me who always contemplate the

00:59:15,312 --> 00:59:17,272 [Hwei]
meaning of life. [laughs] And, but the

00:59:17,392 --> 00:59:17,852 [Hwei]
third one-

00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:18,252 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

00:59:18,272 --> 00:59:20,452 [Hwei]
... but the third one that I can recommend

00:59:20,572 --> 00:59:23,692 [Hwei]
is, uh, The Way of Integrity by Marta

00:59:23,752 --> 00:59:24,492 [Hwei]
Beck.

00:59:25,492 --> 00:59:25,972 [Nicola]
Okay.

00:59:26,652 --> 00:59:27,402 [Nicola]
What can you tell me-

00:59:27,402 --> 00:59:27,402 [Hwei]
Yeah

00:59:27,402 --> 00:59:30,092 [Nicola]
... about these three books? Or I'm

00:59:30,132 --> 00:59:31,492 [Nicola]
curious about the first one

00:59:32,272 --> 00:59:33,112 [Nicola]
since it's your-

00:59:33,752 --> 00:59:33,762 [Hwei]
Hmm

00:59:33,762 --> 00:59:37,152 [Nicola]
... um, guiding principle. What-

00:59:37,192 --> 00:59:37,392 [Hwei]
Yeah

00:59:37,772 --> 00:59:38,572 [Nicola]
... what there is in there?

00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:43,212 [Hwei]
The Diamond Sutra essentially says that,

00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:43,832 [Hwei]
um,

00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:46,612 [Hwei]
everything tangible that you can see in

00:59:46,652 --> 00:59:47,232 [Hwei]
this world,

00:59:48,212 --> 00:59:50,092 [Hwei]
um, is kind of like

00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,492 [Hwei]
it's ever-changing. So, it's kind of like

00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:54,932 [Hwei]
a dream. It's kind of like a dew, and like

00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:57,882 [Hwei]
a morning dew. It's kind of like, um,

00:59:58,252 --> 01:00:01,492 [Hwei]
illusion. It's kind of like a shadow.

01:00:01,592 --> 01:00:03,272 [Hwei]
Um, it's kind of like

01:00:04,232 --> 01:00:04,592 [Hwei]
a

01:00:05,212 --> 01:00:09,172 [Hwei]
thunder, um, and we should see the world

01:00:09,212 --> 01:00:11,892 [Hwei]
this way. And so that has given

01:00:11,952 --> 01:00:12,472 [Hwei]
me,

01:00:14,012 --> 01:00:17,872 [Hwei]
that has given me a sense of saying that

01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,592 [Hwei]
I should not kind of like try to cling on

01:00:20,652 --> 01:00:25,052 [Hwei]
something. Um, I should be really fluid,

01:00:25,112 --> 01:00:28,452 [Hwei]
like if I want to, uh, enjoy the world the

01:00:28,532 --> 01:00:29,952 [Hwei]
right way. Um,

01:00:30,732 --> 01:00:33,862 [Hwei]
and so one of the stories in there, it

01:00:34,032 --> 01:00:34,592 [Hwei]
says,

01:00:35,352 --> 01:00:37,512 [Hwei]
"If you're drowning and then you happen to

01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:40,142 [Hwei]
hug a log," like a big piece of wood.

01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:40,512 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

01:00:40,522 --> 01:00:42,941 [Hwei]
"And then that has saved your life. Um,

01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:43,762 [Hwei]
but then

01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:46,702 [Hwei]
since you're now safe, you're, you're not

01:00:46,832 --> 01:00:48,592 [Hwei]
drowning anymore, you have come to the

01:00:48,692 --> 01:00:49,092 [Hwei]
land.

01:00:49,932 --> 01:00:51,072 [Hwei]
But maybe out of

01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:54,612 [Hwei]
security, you feel like this log is so

01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:56,312 [Hwei]
important for you, it has saved your life,

01:00:56,352 --> 01:01:00,208 [Hwei]
so you just hug it to walk it."But who

01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:02,087 [Hwei]
knows your next quest is to climb the

01:01:02,168 --> 01:01:04,928 [Hwei]
mountain. Like, you cannot... Since the

01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:07,388 [Hwei]
lock has saved you already, you should let

01:01:07,408 --> 01:01:09,918 [Hwei]
it go because your next quest is climbing

01:01:09,968 --> 01:01:11,688 [Hwei]
a mountain. That lock is not going to

01:01:11,748 --> 01:01:12,827 [Hwei]
serve you.

01:01:12,848 --> 01:01:13,048 [Nicola]
Hmm.

01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,778 [Hwei]
And so, that main guiding principle is

01:01:15,808 --> 01:01:18,148 [Hwei]
kind of like, say,

01:01:19,668 --> 01:01:25,098 [Hwei]
everything is as is, as happened. Um, for

01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:26,428 [Hwei]
example, our podcast now

01:01:26,968 --> 01:01:27,988 [Hwei]
is as happened.

01:01:27,998 --> 01:01:27,998 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

01:01:28,008 --> 01:01:30,408 [Hwei]
It's going to end in, I don't know, like

01:01:30,548 --> 01:01:32,328 [Hwei]
20 minutes' time.

01:01:32,968 --> 01:01:33,648 [Hwei]
And I should not

01:01:34,428 --> 01:01:35,408 [Hwei]
cling on it.

01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:35,418 [Nicola]
Yeah.

01:01:35,468 --> 01:01:37,128 [Hwei]
I should not think about, "Oh, damn, I

01:01:37,188 --> 01:01:39,298 [Hwei]
should change something about it."

01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:39,928 [Nicola]
Hmm. I see.

01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,837 [Hwei]
Like also in freelancing, it's like... Uh,

01:01:42,837 --> 01:01:45,808 [Hwei]
in freelancing, you have to have a level

01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:49,368 [Hwei]
of grace, uh, and compassion to yourself

01:01:49,868 --> 01:01:52,087 [Hwei]
for the courage to come out. If you

01:01:52,148 --> 01:01:53,948 [Hwei]
always said, "I have to be perfect. I

01:01:53,968 --> 01:01:56,168 [Hwei]
cannot make any mistakes," sorry, you live

01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,607 [Hwei]
in a classroom. You're not living in the

01:01:57,668 --> 01:01:58,168 [Hwei]
real world.

01:01:58,708 --> 01:01:58,888 [Nicola]
Hmm.

01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:00,567 [Hwei]
Um, if you are living in the real world

01:02:00,748 --> 01:02:02,448 [Hwei]
and you don't want to get to insanity

01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:05,868 [Hwei]
[laughs], just try to

01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:08,968 [Hwei]
do a small experiment, see what it comes

01:02:09,048 --> 01:02:11,628 [Hwei]
back. And if it is not the outcome that

01:02:11,688 --> 01:02:13,688 [Hwei]
you want, just pivot and do better next

01:02:13,708 --> 01:02:14,448 [Hwei]
time.

01:02:14,468 --> 01:02:14,478 [Nicola]
Yeah.

01:02:14,528 --> 01:02:17,808 [Hwei]
So, like don't hug the lock when you have

01:02:17,848 --> 01:02:19,607 [Hwei]
to climb the mountain. Yes, the lock has

01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:21,398 [Hwei]
saved you, it has served you in the past,

01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:24,488 [Hwei]
but time to move on.

01:02:25,968 --> 01:02:27,508 [Nicola]
Yeah. That-

01:02:27,518 --> 01:02:27,638 [Hwei]
Yeah

01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:29,348 [Nicola]
... that's a, that's a great metaphor,

01:02:29,408 --> 01:02:30,348 [Nicola]
yeah.

01:02:30,388 --> 01:02:31,388 [Hwei]
Yeah, so it's kind of like-

01:02:31,428 --> 01:02:31,668 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

01:02:32,868 --> 01:02:36,087 [Hwei]
... I don't see you, Nicola, as Nicola the

01:02:36,148 --> 01:02:37,868 [Hwei]
coachee, because I know

01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,567 [Hwei]
it just happened in this moment that we

01:02:40,628 --> 01:02:43,268 [Hwei]
met and I'm being put in a position to

01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:45,468 [Hwei]
give you some advice, and you're in the

01:02:45,488 --> 01:02:48,218 [Hwei]
position of needing some advice. But this

01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,067 [Hwei]
is not forever. Like, this is not

01:02:50,128 --> 01:02:52,808 [Hwei]
permanent. At some point, these

01:02:54,028 --> 01:02:57,587 [Hwei]
three that I l- look after will grow.

01:02:57,598 --> 01:02:57,598 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,067 [Hwei]
Like, you're going to be a different

01:02:59,107 --> 01:03:01,848 [Hwei]
Nicola, and I don't see you, Nicola, as

01:03:01,888 --> 01:03:03,888 [Hwei]
the first version anymore. Like, I should

01:03:03,968 --> 01:03:07,488 [Hwei]
see you as an ever-changing. And, eh, this

01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:11,968 [Hwei]
is, this is the... This is what I think

01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:15,308 [Hwei]
the, the way that I prefer to look at

01:03:15,368 --> 01:03:16,528 [Hwei]
life. Everything.

01:03:16,538 --> 01:03:16,538 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:18,708 [Hwei]
Like people, person, environment,

01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:19,788 [Hwei]
everything.

01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:23,608 [Nicola]
Hmm. Makes me think of... It ki- I feel

01:03:23,668 --> 01:03:26,837 [Nicola]
it's kind of a translation of this, um,

01:03:27,728 --> 01:03:31,188 [Nicola]
that what serves, served you to, to get

01:03:31,268 --> 01:03:34,028 [Nicola]
here, will serve you to get-

01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:34,078 [Hwei]
Yeah

01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:35,817 [Nicola]
... somewhere else, right? We have

01:03:35,928 --> 01:03:37,048 [Nicola]
different-

01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:37,078 [Hwei]
Yeah

01:03:37,078 --> 01:03:41,218 [Nicola]
... whatever, phases, challenges, uh,

01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:42,808 [Nicola]
growth path.

01:03:42,828 --> 01:03:42,977 [Hwei]
Mm.

01:03:42,977 --> 01:03:45,428 [Nicola]
And something, you need something to

01:03:46,268 --> 01:03:49,468 [Nicola]
get somewhere, eh, but then it won't help

01:03:49,528 --> 01:03:51,817 [Nicola]
you to get somewhere else because it's-

01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:51,968 [Hwei]
Yeah

01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,368 [Nicola]
... constantly evolving

01:03:54,008 --> 01:03:56,548 [Nicola]
journey and challenges and, and stuff,

01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:56,798 [Nicola]
yeah.

01:03:58,288 --> 01:04:00,648 [Hwei]
Perfect. This is a perfect interpretation.

01:04:00,668 --> 01:04:04,248 [Nicola]
[laughs] Yeah. And what, what about the...

01:04:04,288 --> 01:04:06,468 [Nicola]
What was the, the third book that, that

01:04:06,488 --> 01:04:07,728 [Nicola]
you mentioned?

01:04:07,768 --> 01:04:10,888 [Hwei]
The Way of Integrity by Marta Beck.

01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:14,168 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm. And what's the, the message from

01:04:14,248 --> 01:04:15,788 [Nicola]
there, that one?

01:04:15,828 --> 01:04:17,968 [Hwei]
The message is to really honor your own

01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:19,208 [Hwei]
truth.

01:04:19,248 --> 01:04:20,627 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

01:04:20,668 --> 01:04:24,648 [Hwei]
And so, uh, it described like this theater

01:04:24,748 --> 01:04:27,328 [Hwei]
play by... It's called Inferno.

01:04:28,108 --> 01:04:30,087 [Hwei]
Um, so I think it's like, maybe it's

01:04:30,148 --> 01:04:32,348 [Hwei]
Italian story, you know? Like,

01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:34,788 [Hwei]
maybe let me know. [laughs]

01:04:34,828 --> 01:04:36,688 [Nicola]
I'll, I'll look into it. I mean, the-

01:04:36,697 --> 01:04:37,528 [Hwei]
[laughs]

01:04:37,538 --> 01:04:39,748 [Nicola]
... the Inferno from, from Dante is where

01:04:39,768 --> 01:04:40,498 [Nicola]
it all started.

01:04:40,567 --> 01:04:41,168 [Hwei]
Yes.

01:04:41,248 --> 01:04:41,498 [Nicola]
Yeah.

01:04:41,528 --> 01:04:42,648 [Hwei]
It's from Dante, yeah.

01:04:42,668 --> 01:04:43,048 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

01:04:43,108 --> 01:04:46,968 [Hwei]
So, that book is about taking Dante's

01:04:47,028 --> 01:04:47,668 [Hwei]
Inferno-

01:04:48,028 --> 01:04:48,377 [Nicola]
Oh, I see. I see

01:04:48,377 --> 01:04:51,408 [Hwei]
... into examining our life.

01:04:51,417 --> 01:04:51,417 [Nicola]
Okay.

01:04:51,428 --> 01:04:54,028 [Hwei]
And so, it says that it, it goes

01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:56,828 [Hwei]
through... You have to go through the

01:04:56,908 --> 01:04:59,087 [Hwei]
center of the Earth-

01:04:59,108 --> 01:04:59,208 [Nicola]
Mm

01:04:59,368 --> 01:05:01,228 [Hwei]
... and then go to the inferno

01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:04,728 [Hwei]
and then coming out from the other side.

01:05:04,748 --> 01:05:07,087 [Hwei]
And so that book is such a-

01:05:07,127 --> 01:05:07,428 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

01:05:07,587 --> 01:05:11,578 [Hwei]
... supernova for me. Like- [laughs]

01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:11,578 [Nicola]
Okay.

01:05:11,587 --> 01:05:14,448 [Hwei]
Because, um,

01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:19,748 [Hwei]
back then, I just take every advice as is

01:05:19,788 --> 01:05:22,688 [Hwei]
and thinking that if I apply them, um, I'm

01:05:22,728 --> 01:05:26,808 [Hwei]
going to get success or get happier. But-

01:05:26,948 --> 01:05:26,978 [Nicola]
Mm

01:05:26,978 --> 01:05:30,168 [Hwei]
... I forgot to examine myself, like if

01:05:30,228 --> 01:05:32,298 [Hwei]
that advice is made for me or not. Like,

01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,958 [Hwei]
do I see myself in this or do I have a

01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:36,108 [Hwei]
level of understanding

01:05:37,587 --> 01:05:40,808 [Hwei]
that this thing fits me or not?

01:05:40,848 --> 01:05:40,938 [Nicola]
Hmm.

01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:41,317 [Hwei]
Um,

01:05:42,008 --> 01:05:45,178 [Hwei]
and the process of doing that is then to,

01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:47,288 [Hwei]
to

01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:48,308 [Hwei]
find-

01:05:48,317 --> 01:05:48,317 [Nicola]
[laughs]

01:05:48,317 --> 01:05:51,008 [Hwei]
... the truth slowly. And that book, The

01:05:51,108 --> 01:05:53,788 [Hwei]
Way of Integrity, it's basically like

01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:57,488 [Hwei]
explaining or practicing or making you

01:05:57,587 --> 01:06:00,348 [Hwei]
realize what are the ways that you can

01:06:00,428 --> 01:06:03,067 [Hwei]
find your own integrity. And so you have

01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:05,608 [Hwei]
this inner truth as your anchor. And

01:06:05,688 --> 01:06:07,508 [Hwei]
everything has to filter through this,

01:06:08,348 --> 01:06:11,228 [Hwei]
and then you get a sense of clarity, um,

01:06:12,248 --> 01:06:15,008 [Hwei]
when dealing with a lot of noise.

01:06:15,127 --> 01:06:17,828 [Nicola]
I see. So it's like helping you

01:06:17,888 --> 01:06:20,087 [Nicola]
to, um,

01:06:20,728 --> 01:06:23,148 [Nicola]
filter the advice and whatever,

01:06:23,168 --> 01:06:23,648 [Nicola]
[clears throat]

01:06:24,488 --> 01:06:26,127 [Nicola]
whatever people tell you

01:06:26,908 --> 01:06:30,708 [Nicola]
instead of following, uh, everyone in all,

01:06:30,768 --> 01:06:31,087 [Nicola]
in every

01:06:31,127 --> 01:06:33,948 [Nicola]
direction.

01:06:34,168 --> 01:06:36,337 [Hwei]
Yeah. Yeah. It's more like

01:06:37,408 --> 01:06:40,087 [Hwei]
there are two kinds of heart. Um, there

01:06:40,108 --> 01:06:40,908 [Hwei]
are two kinds of

01:06:42,028 --> 01:06:42,788 [Hwei]
hardness,

01:06:43,548 --> 01:06:46,868 [Hwei]
um, that, that we face. Um,

01:06:47,788 --> 01:06:50,328 [Hwei]
one kind of heart is if you're a fish,

01:06:50,368 --> 01:06:52,587 [Hwei]
then if you want to swim to the ocean and

01:06:52,627 --> 01:06:53,868 [Hwei]
then, you know, it's a different

01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:56,108 [Hwei]
environment, you just have to push on,

01:06:56,168 --> 01:06:58,067 [Hwei]
right? Like you have a, you know, you'll

01:06:58,087 --> 01:07:00,208 [Hwei]
be stronger as a different, as a stronger

01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,708 [Hwei]
fish. You'll maybe swim faster or

01:07:01,788 --> 01:07:04,308 [Hwei]
anything. But another kind of heart is you

01:07:04,348 --> 01:07:05,708 [Hwei]
don't know who you are, you don't even

01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:06,787 [Hwei]
know you're a fish-

01:07:06,998 --> 01:07:06,998 [Nicola]
Yeah

01:07:06,998 --> 01:07:08,648 [Hwei]
... and then you're trying to compete with

01:07:09,008 --> 01:07:11,208 [Hwei]
monkeys climbing the tree, and then

01:07:11,268 --> 01:07:13,868 [Hwei]
you'll be stuck thinking, "Why are the

01:07:13,948 --> 01:07:17,422 [Hwei]
other monkeys just seem so..."So light and

01:07:17,572 --> 01:07:19,632 [Hwei]
easy and so effortless in climbing the

01:07:19,652 --> 01:07:22,092 [Hwei]
trees, because you don't even know, like,

01:07:22,152 --> 01:07:23,842 [Hwei]
and, and you're kind of out of breath.

01:07:23,852 --> 01:07:28,072 [Hwei]
[laughs] You're not as good as they are.

01:07:28,092 --> 01:07:29,612 [Hwei]
You're not achieving the height that they

01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,412 [Hwei]
are, but you're half dying.

01:07:32,422 --> 01:07:32,422 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

01:07:32,492 --> 01:07:34,032 [Hwei]
Uh, that's because you don't realize that

01:07:34,072 --> 01:07:35,832 [Hwei]
you're a fish. Like, this is not your

01:07:35,892 --> 01:07:38,772 [Hwei]
lane. Like, go back to the water, like,

01:07:38,992 --> 01:07:41,272 [Hwei]
and, and, you know, swim towards the

01:07:41,312 --> 01:07:42,432 [Hwei]
ocean.

01:07:42,552 --> 01:07:43,652 [Nicola]
Yeah.

01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:43,852 [Hwei]
Yeah.

01:07:43,872 --> 01:07:45,552 [Nicola]
Did you, did you, um,

01:07:46,652 --> 01:07:48,592 [Nicola]
experience some- something like that?

01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:51,392 [Nicola]
There was, there was a time where you felt

01:07:51,452 --> 01:07:53,152 [Nicola]
you were trying-

01:07:53,212 --> 01:07:53,292 [Hwei]
Yeah

01:07:54,412 --> 01:07:54,672 [Nicola]
... to do-

01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:55,812 [Hwei]
Three times.

01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:58,032 [Nicola]
Yeah? Okay.

01:07:58,092 --> 01:08:00,702 [Hwei]
Three times that I have to be almost

01:08:00,732 --> 01:08:03,401 [Hwei]
bedridden [laughs], I'm in a lot of pain-

01:08:04,072 --> 01:08:04,322 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

01:08:04,412 --> 01:08:06,332 [Hwei]
... uh, to realize, uh, I'm not supposed

01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:08,572 [Hwei]
to do a certain things, and usually that

01:08:08,592 --> 01:08:11,212 [Hwei]
comes in terms of, um,

01:08:12,872 --> 01:08:14,492 [Hwei]
the career choice,

01:08:15,432 --> 01:08:15,721 [Hwei]
um-

01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:16,572 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

01:08:16,652 --> 01:08:18,282 [Hwei]
... and, uh, environment

01:08:19,252 --> 01:08:21,562 [Hwei]
and, uh, my

01:08:22,992 --> 01:08:25,892 [Hwei]
attitude trying to climbing the trees-

01:08:25,992 --> 01:08:26,242 [Nicola]
Hmm

01:08:26,242 --> 01:08:28,642 [Hwei]
... uh, while not knowing myself. So yeah,

01:08:28,852 --> 01:08:29,902 [Hwei]
I have had

01:08:30,932 --> 01:08:33,782 [Hwei]
three burnouts in the past 10 years, and

01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:37,252 [Hwei]
the first one was, um, during my software

01:08:37,262 --> 01:08:41,132 [Hwei]
engineering time, and the second one was

01:08:41,172 --> 01:08:43,822 [Hwei]
during my PhD time, and no...

01:08:47,232 --> 01:08:49,612 [Hwei]
During my, uh, data science consultant

01:08:49,672 --> 01:08:51,482 [Hwei]
time, and then third time was during my

01:08:51,512 --> 01:08:52,792 [Hwei]
PhD time.

01:08:52,832 --> 01:08:55,392 [Nicola]
Hmm.

01:08:57,392 --> 01:08:59,412 [Nicola]
And what did you real- realize?

01:09:00,212 --> 01:09:03,052 [Nicola]
Why you were, um... What

01:09:04,592 --> 01:09:06,982 [Nicola]
made it clear for you that you were doing

01:09:07,552 --> 01:09:08,152 [Nicola]
what you were

01:09:09,152 --> 01:09:13,692 [Nicola]
not supposed to do or was not?

01:09:15,832 --> 01:09:19,012 [Hwei]
I realized that

01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:23,432 [Hwei]
I, I never think about checking in with

01:09:23,472 --> 01:09:24,012 [Hwei]
myself

01:09:25,592 --> 01:09:26,121 [Hwei]
if,

01:09:28,072 --> 01:09:30,872 [Hwei]
if being in an environment or doing a

01:09:30,912 --> 01:09:31,472 [Hwei]
certain thing

01:09:32,212 --> 01:09:35,372 [Hwei]
will make me respect myself more or less.

01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:39,092 [Hwei]
So I didn't... So it's more like I

01:09:39,132 --> 01:09:39,952 [Hwei]
keep looking out

01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,952 [Hwei]
and I, I try doing things and I try to

01:09:45,752 --> 01:09:46,972 [Hwei]
come up with a good result, good

01:09:47,052 --> 01:09:49,662 [Hwei]
performance, um,

01:09:51,112 --> 01:09:55,592 [Hwei]
but then I don't know what I'm made of.

01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:56,072 [Hwei]
Um-

01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:56,802 [Nicola]
Hmm.

01:09:56,852 --> 01:10:01,632 [Hwei]
So it's kind of like... Uh, it's kind of

01:10:01,692 --> 01:10:01,992 [Hwei]
like

01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,832 [Hwei]
I am trying my very best

01:10:06,312 --> 01:10:08,092 [Hwei]
just trying to survive instead of

01:10:08,102 --> 01:10:11,812 [Hwei]
thriving, and that comes in many, many

01:10:11,852 --> 01:10:14,672 [Hwei]
ways. Maybe it is with

01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:18,472 [Hwei]
the pace of the project. Maybe it's with

01:10:18,512 --> 01:10:20,552 [Hwei]
the nature of the project. Maybe it's with

01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,712 [Hwei]
the nature of the environment, of what is

01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:27,512 [Hwei]
demanded of you, um, and, and

01:10:27,752 --> 01:10:32,072 [Hwei]
this kind of, uh, self-awareness came,

01:10:32,192 --> 01:10:32,342 [Hwei]
uh,

01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:37,072 [Hwei]
after taking me through excruciating

01:10:37,232 --> 01:10:39,692 [Hwei]
physical pain, um, to, to

01:10:39,772 --> 01:10:42,772 [Hwei]
realize that maybe I should look at what

01:10:42,812 --> 01:10:46,232 [Hwei]
I'm made of. [laughs]

01:10:46,852 --> 01:10:46,992 [Hwei]
Yeah.

01:10:47,052 --> 01:10:49,072 [Nicola]
So you, you feel you were ignoring

01:10:49,852 --> 01:10:50,272 [Nicola]
maybe

01:10:50,972 --> 01:10:54,732 [Nicola]
earlier signals, right? You, you had to

01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:55,882 [Nicola]
get to physical pain.

01:10:55,882 --> 01:10:58,952 [Hwei]
I'm ignoring all the subtle and obvious

01:10:59,012 --> 01:10:59,652 [Hwei]
signals-

01:10:59,932 --> 01:11:00,162 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:03,512 [Hwei]
... that until my body literally can't

01:11:03,652 --> 01:11:04,712 [Hwei]
move anymore,

01:11:05,692 --> 01:11:07,501 [Hwei]
for me to say, "Stop."

01:11:07,552 --> 01:11:07,682 [Nicola]
Okay.

01:11:07,772 --> 01:11:09,912 [Hwei]
Otherwise, I would still keep moving. Like

01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,462 [Hwei]
otherwise, I wouldn't have learned this

01:11:11,492 --> 01:11:15,872 [Hwei]
lesson. So my body was compassionate

01:11:15,932 --> 01:11:17,672 [Hwei]
enough to take a

01:11:17,712 --> 01:11:21,732 [Hwei]
breakdown, to remind myself that, hey,

01:11:21,772 --> 01:11:23,862 [Hwei]
this is not you. Like, this is

01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:28,692 [Hwei]
... You're not... Uh, you're, you're,

01:11:28,712 --> 01:11:30,392 [Hwei]
you're a different vehicle being put on

01:11:30,432 --> 01:11:31,172 [Hwei]
different purpose.

01:11:31,192 --> 01:11:31,432 [Nicola]
Hmm.

01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:32,632 [Hwei]
Yeah.

01:11:32,672 --> 01:11:34,112 [Nicola]
What, what are those signals

01:11:34,752 --> 01:11:37,421 [Nicola]
that someone in, in a similar situation

01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,531 [Nicola]
might catch before

01:11:39,432 --> 01:11:40,052 [Nicola]
getting to

01:11:42,112 --> 01:11:42,132 [Nicola]
pain?

01:11:42,142 --> 01:11:42,792 [Hwei]
Hmm.

01:11:44,812 --> 01:11:46,592 [Hwei]
At, at first, I would say

01:11:47,592 --> 01:11:50,852 [Hwei]
it is, um, little discomfort here and

01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:53,412 [Hwei]
there, and that might come in terms of

01:11:53,472 --> 01:11:55,272 [Hwei]
emotions, that might comes in terms of

01:11:55,352 --> 01:12:00,172 [Hwei]
sensations. Um, and then, uh, the

01:12:00,252 --> 01:12:02,052 [Hwei]
next thing would be you're trying to

01:12:02,092 --> 01:12:03,632 [Hwei]
overcome them-

01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:03,812 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

01:12:03,892 --> 01:12:04,372 [Hwei]
... but

01:12:05,012 --> 01:12:08,112 [Hwei]
you feel that you are slowly giving up on

01:12:08,152 --> 01:12:09,792 [Hwei]
yourself or betraying yourself. Like,

01:12:09,832 --> 01:12:10,992 [Hwei]
you're, you're so

01:12:11,752 --> 01:12:15,092 [Hwei]
kind of like betraying your own truth, um,

01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:18,292 [Hwei]
in order to get better, if that make any

01:12:18,392 --> 01:12:19,942 [Hwei]
sense. Um,

01:12:21,492 --> 01:12:23,012 [Hwei]
and then you

01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:23,872 [Hwei]
keep

01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:26,792 [Hwei]
giving in. So

01:12:27,872 --> 01:12:29,812 [Hwei]
you slowly find yourself-

01:12:29,852 --> 01:12:30,112 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:33,672 [Hwei]
... grinding

01:12:35,492 --> 01:12:36,312 [Hwei]
more like,

01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:39,532 [Hwei]
more like you, more like you feel like you

01:12:39,592 --> 01:12:42,112 [Hwei]
grind yourself off, that nothing is left.

01:12:42,132 --> 01:12:43,762 [Hwei]
Like you're, you're le- you're slowly

01:12:43,812 --> 01:12:47,612 [Hwei]
losing your life force instead of, um,

01:12:48,192 --> 01:12:49,652 [Hwei]
instead of feeling like,

01:12:50,892 --> 01:12:52,762 [Hwei]
"I'm still myself doing this."

01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:54,611 [Nicola]
Hmm.

01:12:54,672 --> 01:12:58,132 [Hwei]
Yeah. It, it's going to feel like, "I keep

01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,132 [Hwei]
running and running and running, but for

01:13:00,232 --> 01:13:03,872 [Hwei]
what?" And maybe your logical brain is

01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:05,332 [Hwei]
going to convince you, "Ah, it's for

01:13:05,472 --> 01:13:07,052 [Hwei]
this," you know, the-

01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:07,222 [Nicola]
Hmm

01:13:07,222 --> 01:13:08,522 [Hwei]
... this, um,

01:13:09,912 --> 01:13:11,672 [Hwei]
nice achievement,

01:13:12,452 --> 01:13:15,182 [Hwei]
and it's for me to prove to myself that I

01:13:15,212 --> 01:13:16,732 [Hwei]
can do this,

01:13:16,832 --> 01:13:21,023 [Hwei]
um-But yeah, um,

01:13:21,684 --> 01:13:25,224 [Hwei]
this is going to... This is kind of like a

01:13:25,284 --> 01:13:28,164 [Hwei]
slippery slope where you, you betray

01:13:28,224 --> 01:13:31,523 [Hwei]
yourself again and again and again. Yeah.

01:13:31,704 --> 01:13:32,724 [Nicola]
Yeah. And y-

01:13:32,983 --> 01:13:33,784 [Hwei]
Those are the signs.

01:13:34,324 --> 01:13:35,943 [Nicola]
Yeah, definitely.

01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,294 [Nicola]
It happened to me-

01:13:37,304 --> 01:13:38,603 [Hwei]
Those are the signs. And then you, you

01:13:38,724 --> 01:13:40,103 [Hwei]
wake up and then you think like-

01:13:40,204 --> 01:13:40,214 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:40,214 [Hwei]
...

01:13:41,044 --> 01:13:42,813 [Hwei]
"Why am I doing this?" Like, like, "Where

01:13:42,904 --> 01:13:44,184 [Hwei]
am I?" [laughs]

01:13:44,224 --> 01:13:45,943 [Nicola]
Yeah, exactly. Wanted to say exactly the

01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,244 [Nicola]
same.

01:13:47,264 --> 01:13:47,893 [Hwei]
[laughs]

01:13:47,893 --> 01:13:48,124 [Nicola]
But

01:13:48,764 --> 01:13:50,324 [Nicola]
it happened to me in the, in the past

01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:50,784 [Nicola]
going

01:13:52,103 --> 01:13:53,523 [Nicola]
into work in the morning,

01:13:55,284 --> 01:13:57,724 [Nicola]
you know. You, you get there, you sit at

01:13:57,844 --> 01:14:02,103 [Nicola]
your desk, you look around and you say,

01:14:02,112 --> 01:14:03,514 [Nicola]
"What am I doing here?"

01:14:03,514 --> 01:14:06,324 [Hwei]
[laughs] Yeah.

01:14:06,334 --> 01:14:06,393 [Nicola]
[laughs]

01:14:06,393 --> 01:14:07,744 [Hwei]
Time to look inside.

01:14:07,884 --> 01:14:08,563 [Nicola]
Yeah.

01:14:08,584 --> 01:14:11,214 [Hwei]
That's a message for you. Read the

01:14:11,264 --> 01:14:14,724 [Hwei]
message. [laughs]

01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,563 [Nicola]
I see. And so you... It's

01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:19,684 [Nicola]
interesting, you, you, you said that this

01:14:19,724 --> 01:14:23,284 [Nicola]
happened to you, um, three times. So it

01:14:23,404 --> 01:14:27,324 [Nicola]
was different things that you discovered,

01:14:27,384 --> 01:14:27,964 [Nicola]
or you went,

01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:32,124 [Nicola]
you went back to, uh, something similar

01:14:32,244 --> 01:14:35,824 [Nicola]
that, I don't know, uh, catch you

01:14:35,884 --> 01:14:37,784 [Nicola]
in a different way?

01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:43,464 [Hwei]
Same feeling, different environment,

01:14:43,504 --> 01:14:46,744 [Hwei]
different faces, different projects. But

01:14:46,764 --> 01:14:49,563 [Hwei]
the feeling is the same.

01:14:49,634 --> 01:14:49,634 [Nicola]
Okay.

01:14:49,634 --> 01:14:50,824 [Hwei]
The feeling is that

01:14:52,464 --> 01:14:53,864 [Hwei]
I didn't stop myself right there

01:14:55,563 --> 01:14:58,204 [Hwei]
and allow myself to do the things or be

01:14:58,443 --> 01:15:01,983 [Hwei]
somewhere or... well, generally do

01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:02,454 [Hwei]
something

01:15:03,084 --> 01:15:07,844 [Hwei]
that make myself respect me less.

01:15:08,964 --> 01:15:09,924 [Nicola]
Hmm.

01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,934 [Hwei]
That's the, that the... That's the

01:15:12,044 --> 01:15:14,063 [Hwei]
question that I didn't think of

01:15:14,744 --> 01:15:16,964 [Hwei]
questioning myself back then, if this

01:15:17,204 --> 01:15:17,964 [Hwei]
would be my

01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:21,704 [Hwei]
decision filtering process that will make

01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:24,244 [Hwei]
a lot of life easier.

01:15:24,364 --> 01:15:27,304 [Nicola]
I see. And there, there were... There was

01:15:27,364 --> 01:15:28,084 [Nicola]
a part of you

01:15:29,702 --> 01:15:32,864 [Nicola]
in the second or third time that says

01:15:35,724 --> 01:15:38,483 [Nicola]
why you, you felt again into this

01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:41,684 [Nicola]
or, or not?

01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:44,244 [Hwei]
No, second and third time I managed to

01:15:44,304 --> 01:15:45,943 [Hwei]
catch myself easier.

01:15:46,164 --> 01:15:46,174 [Nicola]
Okay.

01:15:46,264 --> 01:15:48,554 [Hwei]
Um, and being different from the first

01:15:48,584 --> 01:15:50,983 [Hwei]
time. The first time is kind of like I

01:15:51,044 --> 01:15:53,004 [Hwei]
just graduated university, this is my very

01:15:53,044 --> 01:15:55,574 [Hwei]
first job. I have to do my very best as a

01:15:55,603 --> 01:15:57,414 [Hwei]
A+ student. [laughs]

01:15:57,424 --> 01:15:57,554 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:58,603 [Hwei]
You know, like

01:15:59,324 --> 01:16:02,023 [Hwei]
score perfectly, uh, for everything that I

01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:02,943 [Hwei]
do.

01:16:02,954 --> 01:16:02,964 [Nicola]
Yeah.

01:16:03,044 --> 01:16:06,624 [Hwei]
Um, when I had the first burnout, I

01:16:06,684 --> 01:16:08,744 [Hwei]
actually doubted myself. Like, I actually

01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:10,813 [Hwei]
asked myself, like, "Why am I so useless?"

01:16:10,844 --> 01:16:12,893 [Hwei]
Like, "Why can't I do this?"

01:16:12,904 --> 01:16:12,943 [Nicola]
Yes.

01:16:12,964 --> 01:16:13,114 [Hwei]
Um,

01:16:13,844 --> 01:16:15,614 [Hwei]
but second and third time, no. Like second

01:16:15,643 --> 01:16:17,324 [Hwei]
and third time it's like, "Ah, there it

01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,884 [Hwei]
goes again." [laughs] "I thought I have

01:16:20,004 --> 01:16:22,344 [Hwei]
pivoted, but looks like I have not pivoted

01:16:22,384 --> 01:16:23,914 [Hwei]
enough." [laughs]

01:16:23,914 --> 01:16:26,224 [Nicola]
[laughs] I see. Okay.

01:16:26,244 --> 01:16:26,334 [Hwei]
Yeah.

01:16:26,344 --> 01:16:31,154 [Nicola]
That makes sense. There, there was some...

01:16:31,244 --> 01:16:34,284 [Nicola]
You feel external pressure, and

01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:36,404 [Nicola]
especially in the first time or something

01:16:36,464 --> 01:16:40,164 [Nicola]
that you, um,

01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:46,544 [Nicola]
that it was coming from, from the past or

01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:48,704 [Nicola]
something that you learned when, when you

01:16:48,764 --> 01:16:52,103 [Nicola]
were younger, um, that you needed to be

01:16:52,143 --> 01:16:55,523 [Nicola]
this A+ student, uh, score everything

01:16:55,724 --> 01:16:58,184 [Nicola]
at, uh, the best-

01:16:58,224 --> 01:16:58,233 [Hwei]
Hmm

01:16:58,233 --> 01:17:00,384 [Nicola]
... you felt like some external pressure

01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:02,784 [Nicola]
back then?

01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:04,624 [Hwei]
I wouldn't think it's an external

01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:09,014 [Hwei]
pressure. I think it is more like the...

01:17:10,904 --> 01:17:12,983 [Hwei]
I misunderstood myself.

01:17:13,563 --> 01:17:14,004 [Nicola]
Hmm.

01:17:14,084 --> 01:17:19,084 [Hwei]
Um, only recently, two to three years ago,

01:17:19,184 --> 01:17:19,744 [Hwei]
that

01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:24,603 [Hwei]
I change my perspective

01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,044 [Hwei]
on my existence in the world.

01:17:28,204 --> 01:17:28,603 [Hwei]
So

01:17:30,544 --> 01:17:32,884 [Hwei]
only up until two to three years

01:17:34,204 --> 01:17:34,724 [Hwei]
ago,

01:17:36,044 --> 01:17:38,924 [Hwei]
I used to think that my existence

01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:42,404 [Hwei]
is to be of use by others,

01:17:43,304 --> 01:17:44,103 [Hwei]
is to

01:17:45,103 --> 01:17:45,943 [Hwei]
lose my

01:17:46,664 --> 01:17:47,924 [Hwei]
shapes and forms

01:17:48,784 --> 01:17:51,523 [Hwei]
and then putting myself down to the dust

01:17:52,603 --> 01:17:54,914 [Hwei]
and to just serve others, and that is

01:17:54,964 --> 01:17:56,264 [Hwei]
love.

01:17:56,284 --> 01:17:56,894 [Nicola]
Hmm. Okay.

01:17:56,924 --> 01:18:00,324 [Hwei]
And that is contribution. That was my

01:18:00,344 --> 01:18:00,844 [Hwei]
thinking-

01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:01,904 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm

01:18:01,964 --> 01:18:04,704 [Hwei]
... back then. Um,

01:18:05,624 --> 01:18:06,144 [Hwei]
and yeah,

01:18:07,124 --> 01:18:09,183 [Hwei]
well since this last two to three years,

01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:12,603 [Hwei]
I've changed a lot. [laughs] I'm living a

01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:14,764 [Hwei]
much better life right now, uh, and

01:18:14,804 --> 01:18:17,404 [Hwei]
continue to do better. But yeah,

01:18:18,124 --> 01:18:20,164 [Hwei]
um, that, that, that

01:18:21,664 --> 01:18:22,964 [Hwei]
shift in perspective

01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:27,964 [Hwei]
that I am my own person, I have my shapes

01:18:28,063 --> 01:18:30,124 [Hwei]
and forms and boundaries. This is where I

01:18:30,244 --> 01:18:32,884 [Hwei]
end, this is where other start. [laughs]

01:18:32,983 --> 01:18:36,443 [Hwei]
Uh, I can have my own preference. Uh,

01:18:37,124 --> 01:18:37,364 [Hwei]
I

01:18:38,364 --> 01:18:40,584 [Hwei]
exist in the world, therefore

01:18:41,624 --> 01:18:44,284 [Hwei]
I have the right to interact with the

01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:46,063 [Hwei]
world as me.

01:18:46,084 --> 01:18:46,224 [Nicola]
Mm-hmm.

01:18:46,284 --> 01:18:48,574 [Hwei]
Um, that might sound crazy for a lot of

01:18:48,603 --> 01:18:52,054 [Hwei]
people hearing this right now, but this is

01:18:52,124 --> 01:18:53,784 [Hwei]
seriously... If I want to be totally

01:18:53,844 --> 01:18:58,044 [Hwei]
honest, I only s- started

01:18:58,924 --> 01:19:02,103 [Hwei]
embodying that two to three years ago.

01:19:03,344 --> 01:19:06,904 [Nicola]
Yeah. I, I think it... most people are,

01:19:06,964 --> 01:19:09,924 [Nicola]
are struggling with that. Is, is not, not

01:19:10,044 --> 01:19:11,144 [Nicola]
strange. Or maybe

01:19:12,103 --> 01:19:13,764 [Nicola]
it's strange for someone because they have

01:19:13,804 --> 01:19:15,624 [Nicola]
not thought about it.

01:19:15,644 --> 01:19:15,764 [Hwei]
Hmm.

01:19:15,804 --> 01:19:16,494 [Nicola]
But, uh,

01:19:18,144 --> 01:19:18,273 [Nicola]
many, many people-

01:19:18,304 --> 01:19:19,784 [Hwei]
I'm not going back. I'm-

01:19:19,824 --> 01:19:20,344 [Nicola]
Yeah.

01:19:20,364 --> 01:19:22,764 [Hwei]
It's irreversible anymore. [laughs] I'm

01:19:22,804 --> 01:19:25,443 [Hwei]
not going back. Never ever.

01:19:25,523 --> 01:19:26,824 [Nicola]
Of course not, yeah.

01:19:27,932 --> 01:19:27,942 [Nicola]
[laughs]

01:19:27,952 --> 01:19:28,192 [Hwei]
No

01:19:29,092 --> 01:19:29,112 [Hwei]
way.

01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:32,192 [Nicola]
Yeah. That's, uh, yeah. That's amazing

01:19:32,212 --> 01:19:32,862 [Nicola]
that, that

01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:37,082 [Nicola]
you have been able to, to do that, you

01:19:37,132 --> 01:19:38,392 [Nicola]
know. It takes,

01:19:40,052 --> 01:19:42,512 [Nicola]
it takes, um... Some people, it takes a

01:19:42,572 --> 01:19:44,012 [Nicola]
lot of time and-

01:19:44,032 --> 01:19:44,192 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

01:19:45,192 --> 01:19:47,832 [Nicola]
... you don't even realize because when,

01:19:47,852 --> 01:19:48,012 [Nicola]
when

01:19:48,772 --> 01:19:52,292 [Nicola]
the past you, uh, were not realizing, was

01:19:52,352 --> 01:19:53,132 [Nicola]
not realizing

01:19:53,751 --> 01:19:57,572 [Nicola]
what was happening, right? Uh, or not

01:19:57,652 --> 01:19:58,032 [Nicola]
fully,

01:19:58,772 --> 01:19:59,022 [Nicola]
uh-

01:19:59,022 --> 01:19:59,162 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm

01:19:59,172 --> 01:20:02,182 [Nicola]
... to be able to, to break out of it and,

01:20:02,251 --> 01:20:05,041 [Nicola]
as you said, understand your boundaries

01:20:05,412 --> 01:20:05,882 [Nicola]
and that

01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:10,032 [Nicola]
you exist for yourself with your own

01:20:10,532 --> 01:20:13,852 [Nicola]
tastes and goals, et cetera, et cetera.

01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:13,952 [Hwei]
Yeah.

01:20:14,012 --> 01:20:17,432 [Nicola]
You're not living just for the others. And

01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:18,972 [Nicola]
it's amazing to see you

01:20:19,592 --> 01:20:20,751 [Nicola]
shine now.

01:20:20,762 --> 01:20:20,762 [Hwei]
[laughs]

01:20:21,072 --> 01:20:22,132 [Nicola]
I'm, I'm so curious to,

01:20:22,992 --> 01:20:24,552 [Nicola]
to see where this

01:20:25,332 --> 01:20:28,692 [Nicola]
path will, will lead y- lead you.

01:20:28,772 --> 01:20:30,532 [Hwei]
Mm-hmm.

01:20:30,612 --> 01:20:31,212 [Nicola]
I would want-

01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,302 [Hwei]
Yeah

01:20:31,302 --> 01:20:33,032 [Nicola]
... you to share more of this because

01:20:33,692 --> 01:20:34,312 [Nicola]
it's-

01:20:34,322 --> 01:20:34,322 [Hwei]
[sighs]

01:20:34,332 --> 01:20:37,251 [Nicola]
It's so important and you, you explain in

01:20:37,312 --> 01:20:39,772 [Nicola]
such easy and understandable

01:20:39,872 --> 01:20:41,512 [Nicola]
terms.

01:20:41,612 --> 01:20:43,692 [Hwei]
Sure. We'll be glad to.

01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:43,952 [Nicola]
Share.

01:20:44,092 --> 01:20:46,272 [Hwei]
We'll be glad to. Let's see how things go,

01:20:46,372 --> 01:20:47,052 [Hwei]
but-

01:20:47,072 --> 01:20:47,082 [Nicola]
Okay

01:20:47,082 --> 01:20:48,751 [Hwei]
... I'm feeling hopeful. I'm feeling very

01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:49,942 [Hwei]
hopeful. [laughs]

01:20:49,942 --> 01:20:51,112 [Nicola]
[laughs] I know.

01:20:51,892 --> 01:20:56,582 [Nicola]
That's great. Okay. I think that this is,

01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:57,552 [Nicola]
um, a nice

01:20:57,692 --> 01:20:59,472 [Nicola]
ending.

01:20:59,572 --> 01:20:59,642 [Hwei]
That's great.

01:20:59,642 --> 01:21:01,432 [Nicola]
Thank you so much, Hui, for, for the

01:21:01,472 --> 01:21:02,872 [Nicola]

01:21:04,012 --> 01:21:06,132 [Nicola]
I learned a bit more about you and, uh,

01:21:06,172 --> 01:21:07,712 [Nicola]
you have shared so many interesting

01:21:07,751 --> 01:21:09,492 [Nicola]
things. I hope people can,

01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:11,872 [Nicola]
um, use them

01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:13,172 [Nicola]
to,

01:21:14,092 --> 01:21:16,712 [Nicola]
to grow them, themselves as well.

01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:19,872 [Hwei]
Yeah. Really, Nicola, thank you so much

01:21:19,892 --> 01:21:23,012 [Hwei]
for inviting me to do this. Uh, I am not

01:21:23,072 --> 01:21:24,932 [Hwei]
used to talk about myself. I hope this

01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:27,492 [Hwei]
ends well. But in any case, I've enjoyed

01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:30,412 [Hwei]
