1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,080
Hi, Hwei. Thank you so much for, for doing
this. I took this chance to, to learn a

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,380
bit more about you,

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,639
uh, [laughs] because I think that you have
very cool things to, to share.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,860
Let, let's hope so. Thanks for having me,
and I really look forward to our good

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,740
-conversation today.
-[laughs] Cool. Amazing. So

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,020
let's get started. Uh, you were, you were
sharing the

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,610
-most amazing stories-
-[laughs]

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,330
-... so I'll [laughs]-
-That's it

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:31,330
...

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,360
I'll go from, from there because there is,
uh, some magic there. So-

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,180
-Mm-hmm
-... yeah, before that, maybe a brief

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,620
introduction on what we might touch on. We
know each other from the program Data

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,960
-Freelancer-
-Yeah

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,380
... where, where you h- helped people to
get started in the, their data and AI

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:00,700
freelance journey. And I was curious, um,
preparing for, for this interview, uh,

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,880
where all this started. I think there's
always interesting stories there.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,860
Well, your question make me, like, um,
kind of like rewind to many, many years

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,700
-ago.
-Yeah [laughs].

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,060
Uh, I just, like, graduated from high
school, and, uh, to be honest, I'm, I'm,

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,820
-like, not very tech-savvy at that time.
-Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,220
Like, I just, [laughs] I just learned how
to use the internet for, like, the second

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,660
or the third year. Um, [laughs] uh, and
then, um, I came across this thing called

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,119
YouTube, and then, uh, for some divine
intervention, I just watched a

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,740
Microsoft

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,660
Vision 2020 video. So that was like, you
can imagine, like, I mean, we are now in

26
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,420
2025-

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,820
-[laughs]
-... but I was watching, like, a, a video

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,800
of what Microsoft envisioned Vision

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
2020 to be

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,590
-in twen- in, in 2008.
-Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:04,380
So [laughs] and my 2008 high school self
just got, like, blown

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,440
away, uh, with that video because it is,
you know, it starts with like, "You can

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,730
communicate with, uh, people in another
country." It's auto-translated [laughs].

34
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:22,280
And then, uh, there's this like, you know,
like, uh, transparent glass panel with

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,740
text popping up like, "Oh, your, your
thing is done. Oh, this person has this

36
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,320
update." You'd see dashboard and
everything. At that time, it was just,

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,860
like, unfathomable. And so

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,300
out of curiosity, because I was, like,
like, too... Was still amazed, uh, with

39
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:47,280
that thing, I commented under the video,
[laughs] uh, and says like, uh, "Wow,

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,230
this is such a great video. I am a high
school graduate, uh,

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,880
trying to figure out what should I study
for university. Can anybody [laughs] tell

42
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,300
me what should I study in the university
just to be a part of this magic?" And

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:08,140
then, [laughs] a stranger of, a, a
stranger in the internet, whoever sees

44
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,560
this comment, um,

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,980
that person replied that says, "You should
just go for computer science."

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,600
-[laughs]
-And I'm like, "Whoever that is, thank you

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,160
so much. You're one of the reason [laughs]
why I'm here today, uh, as a data

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,799
scientist and AI engineer in 2025."
[laughs]

49
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,870
We need... We all need to thank that, that
YouTube commenter. [laughs]

50
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,880
-[laughs]
-The magic of YouTube.

51
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,750
-Yeah.
-Amazing.

52
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,700
-A gesture of kindness. Yeah.
-Yes.

53
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,240
-So it's sparked by inspiration really-
-Mm-hmm

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,380
-... of magic-making.
-Okay, so from, from there, you, you

55
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,079
started the traditional path of computer
science.

56
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,040
Actually, software engineering. So, um-

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,600
-Okay.
-So at that time,

58
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,850
-I was living in, uh, a small town-
-Okay

59
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,250
... that is like four hours away from the
capital city, um, of Malaysia, Kuala

60
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,360
-Lumpur.
-Mm-hmm.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,560
And so I pick one university to go and
study. Um, but, uh,

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,440
so, you know, like, at that time, you do
foundation in IT, and after one year, um,

63
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,940
I, I was going to, like, computer science.
But then, uh, the, the school admission

64
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,599
says, "Hey, you are the only one who
registered for computer science. Do you

65
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,520
-mind, like, changing a course?" [laughs]
-Really? Okay.

66
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,479
And so I changed, yeah. And so I changed
to software engineering, um, actually

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,310
software engineering with mult- with
multimedia.

68
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,580
-Mm-hmm.
-And so in that four years,

69
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,280
um, a fascinating tech came out, which is
called, uh, AR and VR, so augmented

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,219
-reality and virtual reality.
-Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,540
And so me and my friends, we were just,
uh, involved in, um, like,

72
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,980
just projects using augmented reality, and
then we participated in, you know, like,

73
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,200
Microsoft Imagine Cup and things like
this. Yeah, so that was bachelor's time.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,340
-Good time. [laughs] It's been some time.
-Cool, and, and then how... Because now

75
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,880
you're, you're not in Malaysia anymore,
right?

76
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,120
[laughs] Yes. 10 years. 10 years in
Germany now.

77
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,160
-Okay.
-Yeah.

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,010
-And how, how do you like Germany?
-It's great.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,500
-Mm-hmm.
-I just saw one of the first Christmas,

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,980
Christmas market booths [laughs] today
that's getting set up.

81
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,640
-Mm-hmm. Okay.
-So yeah, Christmas market is one of the

82
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,460
things that I look forward each year in
Germany. But yeah, Germany is

83
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,400
for this 10 years, I think, uh, I really
have to thank this country for it because-

84
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,570
Mm-hmm

85
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,420
... it really, um, grows me as a person. I
feel like, I, I feel like I've, I've

86
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,880
-grown a lot in this last 10 years.
-Really? Okay. And you, you think-

87
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,720
-Yeah
-... uh, that Germany help you to, to,

88
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,660
-to grow personally? In, in which way?
-Hmm. Yeah, I would say fundamentally, uh-

89
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,419
-Okay
-... because, you know, like, I, I've

90
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,260
basically uprooted myself in one culture,
one country, one environment, and then

91
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,306
being put into, like, such a different
environment....

92
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,616
-Mm-hmm.
-And so, I think the greatest things that

93
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:20,016
Germany has made space for me

94
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:27,616
is to... is to know who I am as a person,
what I prefer, what my

95
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,276
thoughts and preferences are,

96
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:35,916
and what do I want. And then I can go
towards that. And so, I would say in

97
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:42,056
general, like this, um, individual-
individuation, uh-

98
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:44,716
-Mm-hmm
-... this is what, uh, Germany has given me

99
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:50,196
-space to grow into.
-Cool. Yeah, I, I've lived in Germany as

100
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:56,296
well, and I, I think there are some, some
very traditional aspects of, of German

101
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,476
-culture.
-Mm-hmm.

102
00:06:57,476 --> 00:07:04,476
But also there is, um, a big part of
letting everyone be who they want to be-

103
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:05,416
That's right

104
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,046
-... in all weird ways. They-
-[laughs]

105
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:10,796
-... they accept and are very- [laughs]
-Yeah

106
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:11,016
... very

107
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:17,416
particular, you know. And there is n- not
n- not that much judgment around that

108
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:18,696
-compared to-
-Yeah

109
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:21,196
... to other countries or other cultures.
Yeah.

110
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:22,946
-Yeah. That's right. And so-
-Mm-hmm

111
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:23,296
... like,

112
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:29,496
I, I think this is the, the right place,
um, that I'm being put in-

113
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:31,656
-Mm-hmm
-... to actually grow as a person. Like, I

114
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:35,716
know I am not anybody's shadow this way.
I'm just me.

115
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:42,736
Okay, cool. I, I, I remember that, uh, y-
you shared with me some, some time ago

116
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:48,276
that, that maybe you realized a few, a few
changes when, when you went back to, to

117
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:51,356
-Malaysia after, after some time, right?
-Mm-hmm.

118
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:56,056
I, I mean, this happen to me as well. When
I go back to my hometown, home place,

119
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:57,496
after some times, I realize

120
00:07:58,556 --> 00:08:03,496
I've, I've, I'm not anymore the person
was, that was living there, and, uh, I

121
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:09,496
cannot fit anymore in that place because
I've grown in different ways, right?

122
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:11,866
-Yeah, I think no matter where you go-
-Mm-hmm

123
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:18,826
... if you are an expat, um, you feel like
the version of home that you... that,

124
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:23,756
that you were familiar with but you
leave, um, will just be a snapshot in the

125
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:29,046
past because, I mean, Malaysia has grown
so much in these recent years.

126
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:30,556
-Mm-hmm.
-And so, I think as

127
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:34,145
an expat, no matter where you go, um,

128
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:35,696
you feel like

129
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:41,796
you never belong in the place that, um,
you grow into-

130
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:44,495
-Mm-hmm
-... but you're also never home anymore,

131
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:51,476
because home as... has also evolved. But I
don't think that is... I don't

132
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,965
think there's any issue with that because-

133
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,636
-Mm-hmm
-... this is the path that

134
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:58,396
all of us expats have chosen

135
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:06,096
and what's most important is to... as long
as you are feeling you, uh,

136
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:09,556
and as long as you're living
authentically, home is where you are. Home

137
00:09:09,556 --> 00:09:15,936
is not the snapshot that you're left
alone with. Home is also not

138
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:22,906
like... y- you don't necessarily feel like
100% fitting in, uh, into anything, but I

139
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:25,096
am pretty sure, like a lot of locals

140
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:30,775
will also share that, uh, maybe they also
don't feel like they fit into the place

141
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:34,096
-that they have been like growing up in.
-Mm-hmm.

142
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,886
So I think essentially,

143
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:41,736
having this... having this experience just
teach us

144
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:48,136
to realize that... m- to realize that home
is really where you are.

145
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:53,156
Yeah. That's, [laughs] that's, that's the
goal, right? And to, to

146
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:59,636
build your home where, where you are, um,
be, be good with, with you, which is a

147
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:02,775
-journey in, in itself, I, I guess.
-Mm.

148
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,396
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

149
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,436
-Interesting. [laughs]
-[laughs]

150
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:12,296
And where, where in all this, um, AI fits?
[laughs]

151
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:17,516
Oh, okay. Where, where do we... where
we... what, what did we, uh, have the

152
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:21,656
story last time? Yeah, software
engineering.

153
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:24,136
-Mm-hmm.
-And I came to Germany to study, um,

154
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:28,196
intelligent adaptive systems, so I started
my master's in the University of Hamburg

155
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:35,556
in 2015, so [laughs] 10 years ago. Um,
yeah. So, uh, that

156
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:41,896
is, um... that three years, uh, is such a
eye-opener

157
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:43,236
-because-
-Mm-hmm

158
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:46,476
... that's when I really learned the ins
and outs, like,

159
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:48,616
hardcore research

160
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:54,536
and application of machine learning, deep
learning. I was working on this, uh,

161
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:59,856
humanoid robotics projects and some
sensors, you know, pairing that with

162
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:05,056
machine learning and training humanoid
robotics and doing computer vision and all

163
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:05,356
that.

164
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:13,036
What, what do you think of, uh, the last,
um, humanoid robot thing that, um, came

165
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:15,196
-out last week, I think?
-Mm-hmm.

166
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,336
-This, to me, weird-
-[laughs]

167
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:23,176
... robot with the, with the sweater that
[laughs]... you know, the Neo, Neo I think

168
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:25,036
-it's called, uh, Neo-
-Yeah

169
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:26,796
-... something.
-Yeah.

170
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,776
-I think-
-I wouldn't give up things, but the, the,

171
00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:33,406
the humanoid robot, uh, the humanoid robot
that I was working on-

172
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:36,276
-Mm-hmm
-... uh, also starts with N. [laughs]

173
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:38,366
-Okay.
-Um [laughs]-

174
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:41,366
-Interesting.
-Um, yeah. Um-

175
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:44,296
-Mm-hmm
-... you, you guys sort of share very

176
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:46,766
similar names. Um, but then

177
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:51,235
when I think about that version of the
robot with-

178
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:55,086
-Mm-hmm
-... this version, I think-

179
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:55,086
-Yeah
-...

180
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,246
it, it, it, it needs some...

181
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:01,196
-maybe give it five more years-
-Mm-hmm

182
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:05,056
... uh, for another breakthrough. Um, I
think it's more like

183
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:10,216
maybe humanoid robotic is developing a
little bit, you know, needing... it, it's

184
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:15,036
needing more time for all the
non-deterministic situations,

185
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:18,276
non-deterministic scenarios in real life,
um-

186
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:24,432
-Gosh.
-So, I feel that... Yeah. [laughs] Uh-

187
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:25,182
-It takes-
-... if-

188
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:28,952
... much more time than, than people
expect, right?

189
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:30,512
Yeah, but I think it's also the, the,

190
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:35,032
the perception. The audience perception of
it.

191
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,152
-Mm-hmm.
-Because humanoid robotics, this can... It

192
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:39,682
-can be borderline like uncanny, you know?
-Yeah.

193
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:45,212
And so, [laughs] and so, mm, the, the mode
of presentation has to be a little bit

194
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,572
-careful because-
-Mm-hmm

195
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:52,812
... if you, if you present things like,
hey, you have a person that is maneuvering

196
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:54,182
the robot, which means, like,

197
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:57,132
-what about the privacy inside? I, I'd-
-Yeah

198
00:12:57,132 --> 00:13:00,452
-... um ... [laughs]
-That, that's definitely-

199
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:01,382
-Mm-hmm
-... unexpected.

200
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:04,932
-[laughs] Yeah.
-Yeah. But I think that is the safest way

201
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:06,172
-for the team-
-Uh-huh

202
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:06,762
... to actually

203
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:08,952
s- um,

204
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:12,172
in a, in a more controllable way

205
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,112
-ensuring the accuracy-
-Yeah

206
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:19,872
... of the humanoid robot. And so I would
give it some grace, but I also totally

207
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:20,512
understand

208
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:24,672
how uncanny it can feel when,

209
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:32,052
when us just put ourself in the shoes of
the consumer, of the user, and then

210
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,072
extrapolate this presentation

211
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:38,402
-into what might be in the future.
-Mm-hmm.

212
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:38,772
Um, so

213
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:44,832
yeah. If you, if anybody's thinking about,
you know, "Shit, the future is doom,"

214
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:48,672
[laughs] I can totally understand. Like,
this is just a, I think, the handling of

215
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:51,132
the presentation into what

216
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:58,212
the audience might feel. Like, that, that,
that, that can be more considerate.

217
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:04,112
Yeah. Right, because they, the, the end
goal, I mean, not, not everyone will, will

218
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,002
see it the same way, but

219
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,462
most people would love to have

220
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:14,192
someone, if it is a robot, it's fine to
then do all the household stuff for you,

221
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:18,562
right? That, that, that is great. But
it... I feel the technology will

222
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:25,312
need more time than, than expected, even
if Elon Musk, I think, will, is saying

223
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:25,472
that

224
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,011
in the next few years will be

225
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:33,712
there in every home, something like that.
But you have been working, for example,

226
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:36,821
-um, on this from 2015, right?
-Hmm.

227
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:36,992
And

228
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:43,992
you, you think, uh, uh, it has advance a
lot in these 10 years or it's a long

229
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:49,272
-incremental journey?
-I don't think it's going to be

230
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:54,351
incremental. I think it's going to be
exponential, uh, from the rate of

231
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,332
development. Um,

232
00:14:57,652 --> 00:15:02,321
I think it still depends on how the world
is moving

233
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:03,802
and

234
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,832
being somebody who have worked briefly,
um,

235
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:16,492
in humanoid robotics afterwards, I mean, I
have some years in research, um, also in

236
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:18,672
synthetic patient data generation feel,

237
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:20,912
what I think is

238
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:28,692
I can almost hear two sides of things. Um,
one is the voice of the rest of the world

239
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:29,462
who are not

240
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:32,512
in the research and who are not in the
work,

241
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,672
uh, having to apply it. Their, their
concern is real.

242
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:40,472
-Mm-hmm.
-And so that should not be ignored. That

243
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:46,312
should be leaned in and listened to. It
has to be a dialogue, um,

244
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:48,352
for how this, um,

245
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:55,532
for how this can be done in a way that
essentially is affecting everybody, to be

246
00:15:55,532 --> 00:16:01,152
honest. Um, and people, like, voices from
all sides has to be

247
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:03,902
-considered.
-Yeah. Yeah.

248
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:09,712
Um, but then on the other hand, um, for us
who are the practitioners of the field,

249
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:16,552
of the tech, I see a lot of possibilities.
I see a lot of values to be done,

250
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:16,862
-um-
-Mm-hmm

251
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:22,272
... especially in the work that I do for
clients right now. Um,

252
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:24,052
what I see is

253
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,632
intention really matters and

254
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:29,592
what

255
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:36,382
problems are you solving and for who. Um,
humans have to come up with this

256
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:43,552
first and foremost, and then the tech
comes in too. You know, make it, make it

257
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,912
happen in reality. And so

258
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:49,332
I think what we can control right now is

259
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:56,812
whoever is needing the solution and
whoever, like us, is executing or

260
00:16:56,812 --> 00:17:00,972
implementing these solutions, figuring out
for what

261
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:03,452
and for who. It's kind of

262
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,252
our due diligence.

263
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:12,271
Um, and when it's done right, I do see a
lot of possibilities, uh, with the current

264
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:18,552
LM advancements. Uh, and it's just like
the, the, the, the

265
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:21,612
-general, um, you know, gen AI feel-
-Mm-hmm

266
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:26,291
... how it's evolving. Uh, it, it is
really fascinating.

267
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:31,102
Yeah. I mean, we, we of course sh- share
this fascination, right?

268
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:34,612
-Yeah.
-Because we see all the possibilities. Um,

269
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:38,132
but in the, in the last years as this has
become a

270
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:44,352
universal phenomenon and everybody is, is
talking about generative AI and all this

271
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:51,232
stuff, there are all sorts of, of voices
and things going on. Uh, people are

272
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,852
scared or are,

273
00:17:53,552 --> 00:18:00,232
um, thoughts around, you know, all these
things. AGI will, will take, um, many

274
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:00,852
jobs and

275
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:06,772
political things going on. So it's, it's a
mess, right? [laughs] We, we enjoy it

276
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:11,652
because we, we like to build things. I
think that's, that's the spirit, and we

277
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:16,432
see it's just, uh, as a technology, right?
Um,

278
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,672
but most people which are not into this

279
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:26,075
will hear the news, hear whatever, and-...
understand what they, what they can with,

280
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,896
-with the information that they have.
-Hmm.

281
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:34,416
So there is definitely a bridge there, uh,
to, to... There is a gap to, to,

282
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:40,195
to fill between these two, uh, worlds.
Right?

283
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,535
-Yeah.
-And, um, yeah. I guess, as you were

284
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:49,426
saying, it's, it's important to, to pick
the, the right things, uh, in a way and

285
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:55,495
do it well, but also communicate it in,
in, in the right way, uh, so that people

286
00:18:55,495 --> 00:19:01,396
understand and don't have a weird
expectation or, or fears, you know. Is

287
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:05,995
that something that, that, that you feel,
that, uh, that you feel, uh, when, when

288
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:11,775
you work with, with clients or, uh,
interact with, uh, less technical people?

289
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:20,116
You mean, uh, when deal... When
communicating with less technical clients?

290
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:21,626
Mm-hmm.

291
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:28,295
Um, am I understanding correctly that...
Do you think I feel that they care about

292
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:32,055
the for what and for who, or how should
I... How should I understand your

293
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:36,555
-question?
-Yeah. Eh, if, if you, you feel that there

294
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:43,116
is, um, a disconnection between, um, how
you see this technology and

295
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:49,436
what, uh, less technical people expect
from the technology or what they-

296
00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:52,636
-Mm-hmm
-... um, uh, think about it. If they have

297
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:56,716
fears or, um,

298
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:01,755
-how do you say this? Yeah.
-For the clients that c- I come across-

299
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:03,025
-Mm-hmm
-... usually, um,

300
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:08,206
usually, it is not like I go and pitch
that they need a solution.

301
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,795
-Mm-hmm.
-It's more like they come to me that says

302
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:14,576
they need a solution. And so I would say
in my biased

303
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:18,765
small sample size experience, um,

304
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,255
there's less fear

305
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:26,315
when a client comes to me and said they
need a certain solution to be made. Um,

306
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:31,574
there can be, you know, the application of
machine learning or even, like,

307
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:36,534
statistics, um, like traditional, uh, data
insights-

308
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,366
-Mm-hmm
-... predictive modeling, or the bridge of,

309
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:45,596
like, taking predictive modeling insights
and then pair that with, um, LM

310
00:20:45,596 --> 00:20:49,456
generation based on these insights. Um,
but usually

311
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:55,176
when they come to me, they already know
what they want. But then it's up to us to

312
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:58,495
say, "Okay, what is the best way to go
about it?

313
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:06,216
Do we care enough for the project to carry
on a good work for the client? Is the for

314
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:10,765
what and for who aligned with the
implementer as well?" It's like, do I feel

315
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:14,126
proud to put this piece of project in my
portfolio?

316
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:17,396
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh, I think this is then regarding the

317
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:22,515
fit. And if it doesn't fit, just feel free
to, you know, uh, politely excuse

318
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,755
-yourself of this opportunity.
-Mm-hmm.

319
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:29,015
Uh, but then, uh, what I am striving for
is

320
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,956
try to do things that,

321
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:38,476
that are for good, because this is part of
my values.

322
00:21:39,795 --> 00:21:43,995
But for good is also kind of like, hey,
it's... it can be anything. Um-

323
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:44,146
Yeah

324
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:46,676
[laughs] But for me, it's kind of like

325
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:53,636
something that I told, told a lot of our
members, our community members, is

326
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:58,216
when you look back at the things that you
do, even as a freelancer, content creator

327
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:04,055
or whatnot, um, it's okay to feel cringe,
but you don't really want to feel shame.

328
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:07,476
-Hmm. Hmm. I see.
-And so it's kind of like intention

329
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:11,416
-matters.
-Okay. So what's, what's an example of

330
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:15,916
something that you have been... you have
worked on that you're proud of it?

331
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:18,476
-Quite many.
-Mm-hmm.

332
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:20,755
So right now, I am developing

333
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:27,916
a, an automated tool for a consumer goods
company to

334
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:33,775
help the data scientists come up with
stability tests. So basically, stability

335
00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:39,995
test is like, um, you know, when consumer
goods have a expiry date, they have r- to

336
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:43,995
really, like, test their products over
some time and then use some algorithm to

337
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:47,636
-come up with, um, expiry date.
-Okay.

338
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:53,896
So to me, I feel like this is a meaningful
project because I get to save the data

339
00:22:53,896 --> 00:22:54,576
scientist's time

340
00:22:55,416 --> 00:23:00,995
who come up with expiry date for consumer
goods, which this consumer goods will be

341
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:07,096
used by many, many people. And then
another project that I help, uh, to do

342
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:14,716
is, um, the, the pollutants monitoring of
the Rhine water, uh,

343
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:15,605
-system.
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

344
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:21,815
So basically, like, um, basically, like,
part of Germany and the Netherlands share

345
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:25,666
the same water system. And then, um,

346
00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:27,535
I help build

347
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:30,136
sort of like a predictive modeling

348
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:31,576
tool

349
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:39,196
to kind of like say, "Hey, can we..." You
know, it's all sparse data, so and then

350
00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:42,775
data is kind of like inconsistent and
everything, so a lot of processing is

351
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:46,476
involved. But that tool now manage to,

352
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:49,096
uh, kind of like predict

353
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:55,295
pollutants in time. To say like, "Hey,
when a pollutant is being detected

354
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:56,035
abnormally

355
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:58,275
at upstream rivers,

356
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:03,495
then by this and this time, it, it's going
to flow to the border to the

357
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,706
-Netherlands," and things like this.
-Mm-hmm.

358
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,956
And so this is something that

359
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:12,616
when being used correctly can really
benefit maybe

360
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:18,216
the lives of a region of people. Like, I
don't know... I don't know the future

361
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:21,315
usage of this tool, but the implementation
of it,

362
00:24:21,976 --> 00:24:24,995
the intention behind developing these kind
of tools,

363
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:29,976
-uh-... to, to me-
-So, in this project... Oh, sorry to

364
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:33,896
-interrupt.
-No. All good, all good. So this is one of

365
00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:36,456
the, one of the examples of saying

366
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:38,916
some of the projects that I feel proud of.

367
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:45,996
Yeah, yeah, that, that, that makes sense.
Just, um, explain a bit, uh, the, the

368
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:50,696
difference between because that's where I
think it gets confusing for, for people.

369
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:57,536
For example, for this last project, is it,
um, generative AI? Is it deep learning?

370
00:24:57,536 --> 00:25:03,035
-It is traditional machine learning? Um-
-Yeah, statistical machine learning.

371
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:07,276
-Okay. What does it mean?
-It is not even

372
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:13,696
the classical machine learning. Like we
just use statistics as the background

373
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,996
algorithm of it.

374
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:19,476
-Okay. So-
-No gen AI.

375
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,296
-Mm-hmm.
-No deep learning,

376
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:23,216
no

377
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:28,316
neural networks, [laughs] not even random
forests.

378
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:30,476
-Mm-hmm.
-It's just pure statistics.

379
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:33,876
-Yeah. [laughs]
-Oftentimes, this is just enough to solve

380
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:38,156
-the problem reliably.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Because, uh, there is

381
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:40,876
maybe a tendency now to use

382
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:45,376
generative AI with these large language
models-

383
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:48,196
-Mm-hmm
-... for, um, to solve any kind of problems

384
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:53,216
or I... There is this, um, possibility at
least, right?

385
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:54,836
-Mm-hmm.
-And, um, from

386
00:25:55,796 --> 00:26:01,996
simple things like using ChatGPT as a, as
a consumer, as a user, and you are asking

387
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:06,676
-it to, to translate apple to Italian-
-Yeah

388
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:08,736
... and, and it's like using, um,

389
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:10,276
I don't know, a

390
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:13,346
-atomic bomb to, to kill-
-[laughs]

391
00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:14,926
-... a mosquito, right? I, I've heard-
-Yeah

392
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:16,606
-... someone saying that.
-[laughs]

393
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:19,836
[laughs] Because we, we d- I mean, we

394
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,506
can think about it but, um, the normal

395
00:26:23,176 --> 00:26:25,996
people using ChatGPT doesn't realize that

396
00:26:27,056 --> 00:26:32,256
it's, it's a huge technology, right? And
there are data centers and, uh,

397
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:39,036
transformers and all i- incredible
technology behind it that transfer for

398
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:42,436
every simple, uh, conversation that you
have-

399
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,496
-Mm-hmm
-... with ChatGPT, right?

400
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:45,296
-Mm-hmm.
-While for

401
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:52,416
many, many things, it's, it's not needed
that, that so intelligent

402
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,276
technology. You know what I mean?

403
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:57,976
Yeah, but I would say that's a big
distinction-

404
00:26:57,976 --> 00:27:02,676
-Mm-hmm
-... between, um, between the predictive

405
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:03,236
modeling

406
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:04,396
models

407
00:27:04,996 --> 00:27:08,976
with, uh, gen AI or LM models because

408
00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:14,676
predictive modeling is largely
discriminative models. And then the LM,

409
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:21,116
like the things that, you know, ChatGPT or
whoever's coined the term, like AI-

410
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:23,396
-Mm-hmm
-... the big umbrella term, they are

411
00:27:23,396 --> 00:27:25,126
-largely generative.
-Yeah.

412
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:29,716
And so they have different usage. So in,
in, in terms of, like, what you said,

413
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:34,856
you know, I, I want to do translation,
then a generative model can do that very

414
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:41,676
well because, um, you know, you can, you
can put, like, a, like a, you know, good

415
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:46,716
prom and then it's going to come up with
an equivalent version of, like, the

416
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:53,636
translation. But then in predictive
modeling projects, what it needs is

417
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:55,946
-not creativity.
-Mm-hmm.

418
00:27:55,946 --> 00:28:02,016
What it needs is not generating new stuff
but to reliably, based on past data

419
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:09,016
points, to accurately predict things. So
if you take time series forecasting as an

420
00:28:09,016 --> 00:28:15,556
example, um, maybe they have very sparse
data, they don't need a model,

421
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:22,536
like an LM, to tell, "Hey, can you help me
detect anomalies at which point

422
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:27,856
in time when this happens?" Because a
generative model is most likely to make

423
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:30,156
-things up.
-Mm-hmm.

424
00:28:30,156 --> 00:28:34,876
But a predictive model, a discriminative
model, is going to train a model based on

425
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:35,616
the past data

426
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:41,696
and then if the quality's good and if the
model is... ha- has been trained

427
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:43,625
successfully, it can then

428
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:50,326
accurately predict, in time, uh, what
would be the... what would the anoli- amo-

429
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:52,796
-no- [laughs] anomaly be.
-Anomaly. Mm-hmm.

430
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:53,616
-Yeah.
-Okay.

431
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:57,156
So they are for kinda, like, different
usage and that is why

432
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:58,856
I think

433
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:03,416
there are certain use cases for, um,

434
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:10,736
LMs. There are certain use cases that, um,
the discriminative machine learning

435
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:15,516
models or statistical models will still be
in, in demand because they are inherently

436
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:17,956
-for different, different things.
-Mm-hmm.

437
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:24,296
What's the n- the current or, or next
thing that you would like to, to work on?

438
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:29,416
What's, what that excites you right now?
What are you, um, I don't know,

439
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:31,096
experimenting with for

440
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:38,546
-a future client project or...
-Um, I think right now I was too focused on

441
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:43,906
becoming a s- problem solver for worthy
problems. So-

442
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:47,536
-Okay
-... for every project that comes, um, it's

443
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:54,396
important for me to, to satisfy, like, to
be convinced of the for what and for

444
00:29:54,396 --> 00:30:00,696
who. So, if you, if you come with me that
says, "Hey, we, we, we want

445
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:04,506
-a water pollutant monitoring system-"
-Mm-hmm.

446
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:11,436
"... to do this and it's going to be used
by, uh, used by this and this person,"

447
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:11,786
if

448
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:18,496
I feel convinced of this, like, okay, like
goes, aligns with my values, I'm going to

449
00:30:18,496 --> 00:30:19,636
say yes. Because

450
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,476
to me, based on my previous experience in
academia, in industry, I know where to

451
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:33,450
look for solutions. And so it's like right
now, the tools that I have a-...

452
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,230
in my toolbox

453
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,920
is machine learning,

454
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,879
deep learning, statistics,

455
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,620
LMs, AI engineering. And so for all of
those things paired with software

456
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:49,260
engineering, you can basically look for
any solution. You can, you can come up

457
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,860
with any solutions. But what I think is,
um,

458
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,1000
it, as long as there's a worthy problem to
solve,

459
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,280
then it doesn't matter what does it take,
because every

460
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:10,840
freelance project that I'm taking on, it's
just so different. And so-

461
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,790
-Mm-hmm
-... back to your question is kind of like,

462
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:17,640
it doesn't matter what problem for me to
solve, I know I have the toolbox. I, I

463
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,050
-have enough cards to pull out and-
-Mm-hmm

464
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,760
... fundamentally, I know where to look
for solutions. Um, and so for me right

465
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,100
now-

466
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,220
-Yeah, I love it
-... I, ri- right now, it's kind of like,

467
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,180
yeah, if a data science problem comes to
me, then great. If a

468
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:41,220
predictive modeling plus LM, um, project
comes to me, then great. Um, I'm just

469
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,760
-looking for worthy problems to solve.
-So

470
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:51,320
back to, to your beginning, now you know
how to make the magic happen.

471
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,620
-[laughs]
-So you're more focused on

472
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,799
make sure that it aligns with you, right?
Uh, you keep repeating this-

473
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:58,900
Hm

474
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,840
-... for, for what and for, for who.
-Yeah.

475
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,820
Uh, and so you, you, you

476
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:10,160
just search for alignment there. That's
the important part for you. And then you

477
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:16,010
know that you, you, you have so many tools
now, uh, that you can find af-

478
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:20,990
-solution, right?
-Yeah, that's a very good-

479
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,379
-Mm-hmm
-... uh, depiction of where I'm going. Uh,

480
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,1000
-I'm also-
-[clears throat]

481
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,700
I'm also interested to, you know, like go
back to

482
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,060
my main expertise, which is computer
vision. I feel like that is getting-

483
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,620
-Yeah
-... so much less practice since I left,

484
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,740
-uh, my master's degree.
-Okay.

485
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,630
-Yeah.
-So you would like to work on that again?

486
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,739
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. It would be great. It's so fun.

487
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:45,300
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

488
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,869
-Yeah, search for it, right? There are-
-Yeah. [laughs]

489
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:52,059
-[laughs]
-Just need some good portfolio items and

490
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:58,940
-then I will start applying. [laughs]
-Cool. And, um, the, I guess the, the

491
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,100
other, correct me if I'm wrong, the other

492
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,160
big part for, for you, uh, I don't know if
it is half-half or, or different, is

493
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,260
helping other people

494
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,500
in their

495
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,730
-freelancing or-
-Mm-hmm

496
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,480
... business, uh, journey, right? How,
how-

497
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,290
-Yeah, that's how we met. [laughs]
-Yeah, that's how we met. Yeah.

498
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,100
-[laughs]
-And, and yeah, you shared with me

499
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,1000
many things with, about

500
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,110
personal growth and

501
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:35,080
everything related to this kind of
journey, but how, how it started for you.

502
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,440
Uh,

503
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,330
-when, when you-
-For the coaching?

504
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:42,119
... decided to... I guess before then
that, uh, from what, what I know about

505
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,060
your journey, when did you

506
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:50,740
started to have the desire, um, or
conviction to,

507
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,600
uh, be a freelancer, be independent, uh,
something happened there?

508
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,260
Hm. So the first time that I, I

509
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,720
dabble into freelancing was 2020. And at
that time,

510
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,179
so I... [laughs] Continue on the story,
uh-

511
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,420
-Yeah
-... that we left off just now.

512
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,699
-Uh-huh.
-I, I started three years, uh, for my

513
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,820
-master's-
-Mm-hmm

514
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,520
... uh, in intelligent adaptive systems.
And afterwards I took on a full-time job

515
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,239
as a data science consultant, which means
my company sent me to different

516
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,540
organizations and enterprises

517
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:35,219
across Germany to work on data science
projects, um, for those

518
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:42,080
companies. And afterwards, um, in 2020,
shortly before that, I feel

519
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:48,320
like this doesn't align with me so much.
And so I quit. Um, and then I said, like,

520
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,420
I, I really want to, you know, like try to
be, you know, establishing myself and

521
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,920
see, um,

522
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:00,740
how is it being self-employed. Um, and I
tried that. Um, but at that time

523
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,620
I feel like

524
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,700
it's also like,

525
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,740
how do you say? It's also like an
opportunity come by,

526
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:09,900
where

527
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,320
back in my master's time I was already
interested in

528
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,110
things to do with medical healthcare, with
machine learning.

529
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,460
-Mm-hmm.
-And in the middle of doing freelancing,

530
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:28,830
this PhD opportunity came to me. And so I
took on this PhD opportunity and working

531
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:32,840
that many hours, which means I have to, t-
uh, you know, like give up on

532
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,800
freelancing. Uh, but then

533
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,060
I only took on this, uh, research position
for two years, and then I decided to quit

534
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:46,560
again. So first freelancing experience is
in 2020. Like, it doesn't last very long.

535
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,279
I think at most, like half a year, one
year. And then I started properly, um,

536
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:56,950
after I end the contract on this research
position. Um,

537
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,260
and that was

538
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,720
maybe 2024. Uh,

539
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,120
wait.

540
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,550
-2023? 2024. '03 or '04.
-Okay.

541
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,940
So

542
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,120
I was being given a golden opportunity
again, because that time Dave just happens

543
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,140
to open up this data freelancer program,
and then I had the privilege

544
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:29,360
to join the program, uh, in the first
year. And I could still remember how

545
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,080
much Dave and the community has helped me.
You know, in the first year it's a

546
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,904
smaller group and everybody is kind of
like very close together. Um...... and

547
00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:46,654
Dave is, like, hosting these Q&A calls
like he still does, um, today. And then I,

548
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:50,763
I started freelancing properly using what
was being taught in the program. Like, I

549
00:36:50,764 --> 00:36:51,284
essentially

550
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:59,104
apply, tried to apply everything. Um, and
a year after that, I- I think

551
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:01,084
a year

552
00:37:02,484 --> 00:37:03,704
after that, then

553
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:09,444
Dave just says, "Hey, we need a customer
success manager and coach." [laughs] "Um,

554
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:14,724
would you be interested to take on this
position?" And then I was, uh, I was just

555
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:21,044
being humbled by the trust that Dave, uh,
put on me. I feel like Dave, um, customer

556
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:25,174
success is not written anywhere on my
resume. [laughs] But

557
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:30,104
thanks for trusting me. It seems like a
very meaningful role to take on. I'm

558
00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:34,814
willing to try. Like, let's, let's give it
a try. And now it's been, like, one and a

559
00:37:34,814 --> 00:37:40,284
-half years.
-Okay. Yeah. Like, there is so much, I

560
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:42,684
-feel, to unpack there.
-[laughs]

561
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:48,034
Uh, when, when you started, uh,
freelancing and, and

562
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:52,584
y- you des- you, you felt that you needed
help,

563
00:37:53,824 --> 00:37:55,574
-uh, so you, you searched for-
-Mm-hmm

564
00:37:55,574 --> 00:38:00,804
... or you, you come across, uh, Dave, uh,
from, from YouTube, I guess.

565
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:04,364
-Yeah.
-And, and, and joined the program. What,

566
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:08,064
what was that, uh, you needed back then?

567
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:09,784
Hmm. So

568
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:16,944
when, when Dave's program came out, um...
I actually, before this... So in 2020 I

569
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:22,204
already joined some, like, freelancing
programs, but that one was more, like,

570
00:38:22,204 --> 00:38:23,724
it's either general freelancing

571
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:29,563
or, like, a Python base. So, it's not
exactly like machine learning.

572
00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:32,184
-Mm-hmm.
-So when Dave's program is there, I know

573
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:37,844
that he's a data scientist and he's, um,
doing very successfully in freelancing as

574
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:40,084
a data scientist. And

575
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:45,304
his demeanor is just very, you know, down
to earth, as we know, and very smart. And

576
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:51,804
then I like that he walks the talk. Um,
that is the, the,

577
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:56,424
the, the decision where I decided to kind
of, like, reach out and express my

578
00:38:56,424 --> 00:39:02,804
interest to join the program. Um, what I
think I needed at that time is

579
00:39:02,804 --> 00:39:05,344
to,

580
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,674
is to essentially

581
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:12,504
see that I can do it

582
00:39:14,624 --> 00:39:17,204
and I appreciate any kinds of guidance

583
00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:20,564
that if, if anybody who has

584
00:39:21,564 --> 00:39:27,084
w- walked the talk, like, walked this path
before, to see my blind spot, to give me

585
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:27,884
some advice

586
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:35,604
that I could apply for myself. Um, this is
why, like, this is mainly why, um, the

587
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:37,304
rel- the, the, the relevance

588
00:39:38,024 --> 00:39:39,224
of the program itself

589
00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:40,904
paired with

590
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:42,444
thinking that

591
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:47,094
I need some... I need somebody experienced

592
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:49,864
who was on this journey

593
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:53,574
doing very successfully and I can resonate
with-

594
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:57,224
-Mm-hmm
-... to help me to go through this process.

595
00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:00,424
Yeah. Makes sense, right? And

596
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:08,464
wha- what are some, um, I guess, limiting
beliefs or something that you

597
00:40:08,464 --> 00:40:13,324
personally struggled with during, during
that, that first year?

598
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:15,944
-[laughs] I told-
-There is something that comes to mind or

599
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:20,243
-no?
-[laughs] Yes. I told Dave, uh, in a later

600
00:40:20,244 --> 00:40:26,104
interview, I said, uh, "Dave, I didn't
have confidence. I outsourced my

601
00:40:26,104 --> 00:40:28,474
confidence to you, and thanks to you, I'm
here."

602
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:31,384
-Yeah. [laughs]
-"I'm in the game." [laughs]

603
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:31,993
-I, I-
-And then-

604
00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:36,584
... I think you, you told me that phrase
the first time that we met. I wrote it

605
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:36,874
-down.
-Oh. [laughs]

606
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:41,474
And I [laughs], I, I always remembered it.
[laughs]

607
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:43,314
[laughs] Yeah, and I'm trying to do that
to all the-

608
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:45,504
-Yeah
-... community members now. Like, I'm like,

609
00:40:46,304 --> 00:40:48,984
"I know what you need, um, based on,

610
00:40:49,904 --> 00:40:52,644
base- based on the fact that I'm also in
the game."

611
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:54,493
-Mm-hmm.
-Um,

612
00:40:55,564 --> 00:40:56,204
and so

613
00:40:57,824 --> 00:41:04,104
if you, if you can leave the rest to us
and then just say, "I want to go

614
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:08,614
here," we'll help you get there. And so in
a way-

615
00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:09,254
-Yeah
-... uh, I'm trying to

616
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:14,264
be outsourced, the confidence, [laughs] as
I, as I unknowingly outsource they've...

617
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:18,163
-my confidence before. [laughs] Yeah.
-[laughs]

618
00:41:18,163 --> 00:41:21,534
-Yeah.
-You're now passing on, right, to, to them,

619
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:26,924
to us, to, to the other r- rest of the
people in, in the community?

620
00:41:26,924 --> 00:41:28,884
Yeah, but I also think it's my pleasure.
Like-

621
00:41:28,884 --> 00:41:33,244
-Mm-hmm
-... it, it, it is just such a pleasure to,

622
00:41:34,484 --> 00:41:37,413
-to witness everybody's journey because-
-Mm-hmm

623
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:43,254
... oh, it's better than movies. It's
better than watching movies. [laughs]

624
00:41:43,254 --> 00:41:44,983
-It's real.
-Like, look at your experience. Like, look

625
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:48,204
at your journey, like, um, from the first
time that we talk

626
00:41:49,124 --> 00:41:53,504
and until today, you have grown a lot and
you have also achieved some things along

627
00:41:53,504 --> 00:41:54,574
-the way.
-Yeah.

628
00:41:54,574 --> 00:42:00,024
And so this takes, like, you know, you see
a real-life scenario in different people,

629
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:02,344
-you see the stories in different people.
-Mm-hmm.

630
00:42:02,344 --> 00:42:05,504
Um, I think,

631
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:10,904
I think my role is just to remind
everybody

632
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:19,353
what they know already within themself. I
just reinforce that, "Nicola, based on

633
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:25,924
what we talk, I think you are this and
this person." Um, "If this is your goal,

634
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:32,244
I help you hold, uh, the... your, your
ideal self in my mind, and in my mind,

635
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:37,744
every goal that you told me that you're
going to achieve, I consider it, I

636
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:43,972
consider it done already. And now I'm just
walking this process with you."... e- but

637
00:42:43,972 --> 00:42:46,002
in my mind, it's already done, and I'm
just-

638
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:47,522
-Mm-hmm
-... waiting for one day in the future

639
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:52,572
that you'll come back to tell me that yes,
"Hui, I'm already in my ideal self." And,

640
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:57,162
a- and I'll be just like, "Yeah, I knew
it. I knew it a long time ago." [laughs]

641
00:42:57,162 --> 00:43:01,752
[laughs] Yeah. Yeah, that, that makes
sense. But, um,

642
00:43:02,932 --> 00:43:07,832
what... now that you have seen people
going, going through this, what, what are

643
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:11,142
the skills to be coachable?

644
00:43:12,612 --> 00:43:16,232
What are the skills to be coachable? Wow,
that's such a great question. Let me

645
00:43:16,232 --> 00:43:18,312
think.

646
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:22,112
I think it's mostly

647
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,562
-the humility-
-Mm-hmm

648
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:24,562
...

649
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,032
to see a different

650
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:30,392
perspective of the story.

651
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:36,432
-What do you mean?
-A lot of people,

652
00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:38,932
um... so

653
00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:43,462
in my experience, I feel that

654
00:43:44,512 --> 00:43:46,432
I cannot help those people

655
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:52,132
who cannot believe in another

656
00:43:53,852 --> 00:43:56,392
version of narration. So

657
00:43:57,632 --> 00:43:58,712
what they want is,

658
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:01,592
"I'm stuck here.

659
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:08,972
Don't convince me otherwise." And then
they try to... they're not receptive

660
00:44:10,332 --> 00:44:15,512
to the other things. So I would say, first
of all, the humility to accept that

661
00:44:16,372 --> 00:44:18,072
reality has different narration,

662
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:25,812
and you just have to... other- rather than
seeing it as

663
00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:26,672
good or bad,

664
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:33,652
see it as pros and cons. And then see
yourself as one avatar in the sandbox,

665
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:40,202
and says, "I'm here. This is where I want
to go. What is beneficial for me to take?"

666
00:44:40,202 --> 00:44:45,612
And people with narrate, a certain
narration, they are very s- you know, very

667
00:44:45,612 --> 00:44:47,542
-convinced of something-
-Mm-hmm

668
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:51,541
... when I see that it, this convincing
reality

669
00:44:52,592 --> 00:44:56,192
does not serve them, uh, and if they,

670
00:44:57,032 --> 00:44:58,272
if they are not ready

671
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:00,312
to accept

672
00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:05,912
other possibilities, other narration that
says, "Hey, maybe you can look into here

673
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,292
and that," um,

674
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:14,332
I, I think if they are very... if, if they
decide to stay in this narration, there's

675
00:45:14,332 --> 00:45:17,752
-nothing that I can do.
-I see.

676
00:45:17,752 --> 00:45:18,302
-Yeah.
-So, and during-

677
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:22,972
Also, this is one. Second would be
accountability.

678
00:45:22,972 --> 00:45:25,652
-Okay.
-This is what we do every week, Nicolas.

679
00:45:25,652 --> 00:45:29,972
-[laughs]
-[laughs] I know that part well.

680
00:45:29,972 --> 00:45:32,592
-[laughs] Yeah.
-Okay. But-

681
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:34,502
-Accountability. Do they follow up?
-Mm-hmm.

682
00:45:34,502 --> 00:45:36,261
Do they follow through, um,

683
00:45:37,592 --> 00:45:43,332
with, with the things that they should be
doing, they said they would do?

684
00:45:43,332 --> 00:45:47,112
-Yeah. So-
-Because action moves the needle, right?

685
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:50,041
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

686
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,312
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. I, I was
curious to, to

687
00:45:52,952 --> 00:45:58,112
dig a bit deeper on, on the first part
that you... uh, what you said, right?

688
00:45:58,112 --> 00:45:59,652
-Mm-hmm.
-So I'm hearing that if someone

689
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:01,472
has

690
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:06,152
-their own narration, es-
-Hmm

691
00:46:06,152 --> 00:46:09,012
... so it, like a story that they tell
themself

692
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:10,582
and they,

693
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,452
they are not willing to

694
00:46:14,512 --> 00:46:15,712
see another story-

695
00:46:16,632 --> 00:46:20,932
-Hmm
-... but they want to g- to get somewhere,

696
00:46:20,932 --> 00:46:26,912
uh, to their goals. And y- you, you help
them s- realize that, uh,

697
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:32,252
to get there, they need to, to change, um,
the narration,

698
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:34,732
right? So if they-

699
00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:37,572
-Mm-hmm
-... are not flexible in that way or they

700
00:46:37,572 --> 00:46:37,852
don't

701
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:45,432
l- listen that there is another, um, uh,
narration, there is another story that

702
00:46:45,432 --> 00:46:48,832
-serves you better to, to get there-
-Mm-hmm

703
00:46:50,912 --> 00:46:52,332
... um, it's difficult to, to help

704
00:46:52,952 --> 00:46:57,412
someone stuck in that situation. Is that
what, what you mean?

705
00:46:57,412 --> 00:46:58,762
-Yeah. So-
-Mm-hmm

706
00:46:58,762 --> 00:47:02,652
... if they, i- if they feel that it is
more,

707
00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:11,012
it is more valuable to hold onto the
current narration that put them in current

708
00:47:11,012 --> 00:47:11,712
situation

709
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:15,152
and they are not ready to

710
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:21,532
see elsewhere. You know, like even to be
open for the possibility, the other

711
00:47:21,532 --> 00:47:22,192
narration of

712
00:47:22,892 --> 00:47:27,432
maybe there's some other things that you
can still try or maybe there is some

713
00:47:27,432 --> 00:47:32,772
interpretation of your assumptions, uh,
that you can maybe tweak a little bit.

714
00:47:32,772 --> 00:47:39,632
Maybe, maybe that, that can be... that can
move you forward a little bit. So, um,

715
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:44,132
yeah. So if, if they,

716
00:47:45,052 --> 00:47:50,032
if they feel more secure by holding onto
this,

717
00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:53,832
-this narration-
-Mm-hmm

718
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:58,432
... um, I will honor that. I will make
space. I- I will make space for that as

719
00:47:58,432 --> 00:48:05,252
well to say that, "It's okay. I can see
that you're not ready to, to, to

720
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:11,752
explore or this narration, um, uh, at this
moment." And so, um,

721
00:48:13,252 --> 00:48:14,772
I, I, I feel that

722
00:48:15,452 --> 00:48:17,461
it is also important to

723
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:23,222
make them feel okay that this narration
right now that

724
00:48:24,452 --> 00:48:29,272
they, they ho- like, they hug, like
hugging a log just to not drown-

725
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:31,892
-Mm-hmm
-... um, it's okay to

726
00:48:32,772 --> 00:48:35,152
acknowledge that and give space

727
00:48:35,852 --> 00:48:36,892
for them to

728
00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:44,612
-do this until they are ready again.
-Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I recognize

729
00:48:44,612 --> 00:48:51,584
your... y- you have this, um...... way of
helping

730
00:48:51,584 --> 00:48:57,864
people. Uh, yeah, that is, uh, you know,
everyone has their own, um,

731
00:48:59,344 --> 00:49:00,384
way of going to

732
00:49:01,544 --> 00:49:04,314
coach someone in, in these situations,
right?

733
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,684
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh, there are some more, um, I don't know

734
00:49:07,684 --> 00:49:12,624
how to call it, more strict in a way, uh,
but y- you can

735
00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:15,924
go and, and

736
00:49:16,764 --> 00:49:18,644
take someone from where they are,

737
00:49:20,064 --> 00:49:25,464
uh, as you've said, acknowledge that they,
in this moment, they might need something

738
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:29,334
else, right, that you cannot force them,
uh,

739
00:49:29,944 --> 00:49:34,804
-right? That is a more gradual journey-
-Hmm

740
00:49:34,804 --> 00:49:38,944
... uh, that comes with, with whatever
time and type of journey-

741
00:49:38,944 --> 00:49:41,384
-[laughs]
-... uh, someone needs, right? [laughs]

742
00:49:41,384 --> 00:49:44,904
Have you heard about the story of the
mushroom man?

743
00:49:44,904 --> 00:49:50,673
-Mushroom... No.
-Okay. So, um-

744
00:49:50,673 --> 00:49:52,924
-Tell me.
-I watched this story from the internet, so

745
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:55,844
I don't know where to cite this from, but
this story's-

746
00:49:55,844 --> 00:49:57,483
-Yeah
-... stuck with my head. And-

747
00:49:57,484 --> 00:49:59,744
-Hmm
-... I've been sl- I've been secretly

748
00:49:59,744 --> 00:50:02,164
applying to all of you guys [laughs] all
along.

749
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:08,124
-Oh. Let's see.
-So, [laughs] so the mushroom man is,

750
00:50:08,124 --> 00:50:14,044
hmm, there's a guy who is so convinced
that he is a mushroom, he's not a m-

751
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,024
-human.
-Okay.

752
00:50:15,024 --> 00:50:17,324
-So, [laughs], a guy is so convinced-
-[laughs]

753
00:50:17,324 --> 00:50:21,804
... that he's a mushroom, and so he just
take this umbrella and then just stood on

754
00:50:21,804 --> 00:50:26,374
one side all along. Like, he just wants to
be a mushroom. Like, he's so-

755
00:50:26,374 --> 00:50:28,144
-Okay
-... convinced that he is a mushroom.

756
00:50:28,144 --> 00:50:31,184
-Believe me, this.
-Yeah. [laughs] And then, of course,

757
00:50:31,244 --> 00:50:35,024
other people who care for him will say
like, "You're not a mushroom. You're

758
00:50:35,024 --> 00:50:37,454
human." Like, "Come on." [laughs] It's
like-

759
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:38,924
-Mm-hmm
-..."Look at yourself. You don't look like

760
00:50:38,924 --> 00:50:43,724
a mushroom," but that guy is just so
convinced to be a mushroom and nobody can

761
00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:45,534
change his mind. Um,

762
00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:48,504
and so one day, a person comes along

763
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:53,804
and [sighs] he just take another umbrella
and just sit next to him.

764
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,164
-Uh-huh.
-And then that mushroom guy said,

765
00:50:57,224 --> 00:51:00,644
"Hey, what are you doing here?" And then
that guy just says like,

766
00:51:01,404 --> 00:51:04,344
"I'm also a mushroom." [laughs]

767
00:51:04,984 --> 00:51:09,514
And then that guy says, "Huh. Oh, we're
mushroom friends now."

768
00:51:09,514 --> 00:51:11,624
-[laughs]
-And after, you know, sitting, sitting with

769
00:51:11,624 --> 00:51:18,583
that guy for, for some time, that, that
guy just started to stand and

770
00:51:18,584 --> 00:51:23,604
walk. And then the mushroom man just
freaked out. And then [laughs] that

771
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:28,824
mushroom is like, "Hey, you're a mushroom.
How can you do this?" And then that guy

772
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:32,894
just said, "You don't know? It's 2025.
Mushrooms can walk."

773
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:37,764
-[sniffs]
-And then that guy says, "Huh. Interesting.

774
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:42,364
Are you... Okay? Mushrooms can walk?" And
he's like, "Of course. All mushrooms can

775
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:46,604
walk this year, starting this year." And
then the mushroom guy just stand up and

776
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:52,844
walked. And so the moral of the story is,
um,

777
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,224
righteousness is not my goal

778
00:51:57,884 --> 00:51:59,244
-in coaching.
-Hmm.

779
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:05,504
Um, the intention to making somebody, um,
seeing the potential in somebody, that

780
00:52:05,504 --> 00:52:11,204
this person is not a mushroom, is a human,
and he has the place that he needs to go.

781
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:15,164
Um, I don't have to be right. I just have
to

782
00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:16,584
try my best

783
00:52:17,404 --> 00:52:21,284
to have the intention to get this person
into where

784
00:52:21,924 --> 00:52:26,804
-they want to go.
-Yeah. Now, it, it makes... Yeah,

785
00:52:26,804 --> 00:52:30,833
definitely, it's how you're helping us. It
makes sense. [laughs]

786
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:35,884
-[laughs] Now you know my trick. [laughs]
-Yeah. [laughs] No, this is great. Yeah,

787
00:52:35,884 --> 00:52:39,304
and I, I mean, it's... These stories help
you to

788
00:52:40,204 --> 00:52:46,484
fix, uh, fix some, some ideas, but, you
know, I, I, I see, uh, you know, where,

789
00:52:46,484 --> 00:52:47,174
where...

790
00:52:48,964 --> 00:52:50,754
from where you, you come from, and, uh,

791
00:52:52,484 --> 00:52:55,434
different people need different things.
Someone

792
00:52:56,064 --> 00:52:57,364
works better with a

793
00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:01,134
-carrot and stick approach, and, uh-
-[laughs]

794
00:53:01,134 --> 00:53:05,524
... someone who... It's, it's a mush-
someone is a mushroom. [laughs] They need

795
00:53:05,524 --> 00:53:09,984
a different approach to this. Uh, yeah,
that, yeah, I can relate to that. It

796
00:53:09,984 --> 00:53:13,144
-makes, makes sense. And, uh-
-Yeah, it just happen that I don't have to

797
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:14,084
-be right.
-Yeah.

798
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:18,804
I don't have to, I don't need to have
another people told me that I'm right

799
00:53:19,724 --> 00:53:25,044
for me to feel good about myself. Like, I
just, like, I care about another person,

800
00:53:25,044 --> 00:53:30,204
and for this care, uh, I would do my best.
I know, I know my goal. That my goal is

801
00:53:30,204 --> 00:53:34,544
-not to be right.
-Hmm. Mm-hmm. Is to, to get someone

802
00:53:35,164 --> 00:53:36,644
where they want to go. Yeah.

803
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:39,614
-Okay, cool. So that's, that's-
-[clears throat]

804
00:53:39,614 --> 00:53:45,004
... let's say, the first, uh, skill that,
that, that you mentioned. The second

805
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:48,284
-important one is accountability, right?
-Hmm.

806
00:53:48,284 --> 00:53:49,444
And, and so why

807
00:53:50,304 --> 00:53:50,844
some of us

808
00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:53,724
ask everyone

809
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,504
[laughs] some- sometimes we, we are not
able to

810
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:03,964
do what we say that, uh, we want to do.
Why we need that

811
00:54:03,964 --> 00:54:05,844
accountability?

812
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:08,824
Accountability

813
00:54:10,004 --> 00:54:16,474
helps you make progress. And there can be
many reasons why, mm, you cannot do

814
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:20,114
what you wanted to do. You might be
lacking

815
00:54:21,244 --> 00:54:27,224
skills. You might be lacking some tools.
You might be lacking the permission that

816
00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:32,844
only you can give to yourself. And another
people just have to remind you that, um,

817
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:37,764
the power is not outside. The power is
inside.

818
00:54:37,764 --> 00:54:41,044
-Hmm.
-And these are the things that

819
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:45,784
I think in life we just rely on the
kindness of another person

820
00:54:46,504 --> 00:54:48,814
to help you move forward, and that is how
we,

821
00:54:50,344 --> 00:54:56,492
that is how we choose to interact with the
world, to...To be willing to accept the

822
00:54:56,492 --> 00:55:03,211
goodness from other people, and then pass
it forward.

823
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:04,932
Okay.

824
00:55:05,752 --> 00:55:06,262
[sniffs] Okay.

825
00:55:07,112 --> 00:55:11,572
Yeah, you know, I was, I was expecting a
totally different, uh-

826
00:55:11,572 --> 00:55:14,152
-[laughs]
-... totally different answer, and I'm

827
00:55:14,152 --> 00:55:15,532
realizing, yeah, that

828
00:55:16,832 --> 00:55:22,312
I don't know, in the couple last days,
and now I'm connecting random dots.

829
00:55:22,312 --> 00:55:23,082
-[laughs]
-Uh,

830
00:55:23,932 --> 00:55:28,192
[laughs] excuse me if it doesn't make
sense. But no, I think it makes some sense

831
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:34,132
because they're... When I think about
accountability or these kind of topics,

832
00:55:34,132 --> 00:55:40,892
uh, coaching and, and people going through
some personal development journey, I feel

833
00:55:40,892 --> 00:55:41,082
the

834
00:55:43,232 --> 00:55:47,212
predominant narrative online, especially
YouTube or

835
00:55:47,872 --> 00:55:54,192
the, the influences that I see, thanks to
the algorithm, algorithm of whatever, are

836
00:55:55,072 --> 00:56:00,731
quite strong, right? You know, more
masculine energy in a way.

837
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,152
-Mm-hmm.
-The Tony Robbins or

838
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:08,712
this kind of motivational stuff, right?
Makes sense?

839
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:14,632
-Mm-hmm.
-While in, in your answer, I feel

840
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:17,162
-definitely a different energy, uh-
-Okay

841
00:56:17,162 --> 00:56:22,332
... that is not the predominant one
because predominant is louder and

842
00:56:22,332 --> 00:56:22,752
definitely

843
00:56:24,232 --> 00:56:27,332
-more masculine. I, I feel there-
-Mm-hmm

844
00:56:28,012 --> 00:56:32,572
... at least, uh, yeah, as I said, what,
what we see online, et cetera, is more

845
00:56:33,532 --> 00:56:36,952
men doing this, at least, uh, what, what I
receive from

846
00:56:37,652 --> 00:56:39,772
the algorithm. And while

847
00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:44,072
the, your angle is, is, is different in
this-

848
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:47,512
-[laughs]
-Yeah. And it's, it's a, it's good that

849
00:56:47,512 --> 00:56:49,942
-there is another angle, right?
-Yeah.

850
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:52,932
And that we normally don't, don't see.
What do you think?

851
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:55,952
Yeah, I'm glad that I contribute a little
bit to that. Uh-

852
00:56:55,952 --> 00:56:58,972
-Yeah
-... but I also see that, um,

853
00:56:59,692 --> 00:57:02,302
-I think you just have to look, um-
-Mm-hmm

854
00:57:02,302 --> 00:57:05,171
... advice like this also exists on the
internet.

855
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:05,481
-Yeah.
-Um,

856
00:57:06,332 --> 00:57:07,241
I think it's more like,

857
00:57:08,052 --> 00:57:11,772
if, if you don't realize, like, you just
don't know what you don't know. I think,

858
00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:15,572
and this happens with a lot of people, and
especially the, the design of the

859
00:57:15,572 --> 00:57:17,792
-algorithm is more like bubble-like.
-Mm-hmm.

860
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:23,172
Like, you get more of what you look at and
what you consume. And so you, you know,

861
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:25,592
from time to time, look, look the other
side. [laughs]

862
00:57:25,592 --> 00:57:30,172
Yeah. [laughs] You have some
recommendation for the other side? What,

863
00:57:30,172 --> 00:57:31,222
what, what are some

864
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,412
resources or some people that influenced
you?

865
00:57:35,712 --> 00:57:40,032
Oh, resources and people. Um,

866
00:57:42,452 --> 00:57:47,092
I don't know, where do I start? [laughs]
It's like in the, in, in which topic?

867
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:50,692
Yeah, in this kind of, uh, I think now we
are in the

868
00:57:51,372 --> 00:57:52,872
personal development

869
00:57:53,812 --> 00:57:54,472
or, um,

870
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,912
doing something that you have never done
before.

871
00:57:58,912 --> 00:58:01,732
-Mm-hmm.
-In this case, it's, uh, your business,

872
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:03,741
-your freelance journey.
-Mm-hmm.

873
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:06,192
And so there is that struggle to do
something that

874
00:58:07,312 --> 00:58:10,012
you have not done before. And so you might
need

875
00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:15,612
what we are talking about, right? Changing
your story, uh, accountability, someone

876
00:58:15,612 --> 00:58:18,212
-that helps you.
-Hmm.

877
00:58:18,212 --> 00:58:19,492
So, in this realm of

878
00:58:20,712 --> 00:58:22,672
personal growth,

879
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:27,912
what, um, most influenced you or you like
to read,

880
00:58:28,712 --> 00:58:29,622
-look up to-
-[laughs]

881
00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:30,772
... go back to?

882
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:39,112
I am currently reading... So, go back to,
I have one principle book that help me,

883
00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:43,832
like that is the guiding light, uh, of, of
my life.

884
00:58:43,832 --> 00:58:46,592
-Mm-hmm.
-And then some supplementary books. And,

885
00:58:46,592 --> 00:58:51,352
um, but yeah, I can share them. So,

886
00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:55,072
my guiding principle resource

887
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:59,462
-is, uh, Diamond Sutra by the Buddha.
-Okay.

888
00:58:59,462 --> 00:59:02,652
And then I am currently reading,

889
00:59:03,592 --> 00:59:07,962
I'm currently reading Tao Te Ching by Lao
Tzu.

890
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:10,412
-Okay.
-Um, but they are very meta, they're very,

891
00:59:11,912 --> 00:59:15,312
they're very like [laughs] they are for
people like me who always contemplate the

892
00:59:15,312 --> 00:59:17,892
meaning of life. [laughs] And, but the
third one-

893
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:20,452
-Mm-hmm
-... but the third one that I can recommend

894
00:59:20,452 --> 00:59:24,492
is, uh, The Way of Integrity by Marta
Beck.

895
00:59:25,492 --> 00:59:25,972
Okay.

896
00:59:26,652 --> 00:59:27,402
-What can you tell me-
-Yeah

897
00:59:27,402 --> 00:59:31,492
... about these three books? Or I'm
curious about the first one

898
00:59:32,272 --> 00:59:33,112
since it's your-

899
00:59:33,752 --> 00:59:37,192
-Hmm
-... um, guiding principle. What-

900
00:59:37,192 --> 00:59:38,572
-Yeah
-... what there is in there?

901
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:43,832
The Diamond Sutra essentially says that,
um,

902
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:47,232
everything tangible that you can see in
this world,

903
00:59:48,212 --> 00:59:50,092
um, is kind of like

904
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,932
it's ever-changing. So, it's kind of like
a dream. It's kind of like a dew, and like

905
00:59:54,932 --> 01:00:01,592
a morning dew. It's kind of like, um,
illusion. It's kind of like a shadow.

906
01:00:01,592 --> 01:00:03,272
Um, it's kind of like

907
01:00:04,232 --> 01:00:04,592
a

908
01:00:05,212 --> 01:00:11,952
thunder, um, and we should see the world
this way. And so that has given

909
01:00:11,952 --> 01:00:12,472
me,

910
01:00:14,012 --> 01:00:17,872
that has given me a sense of saying that

911
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:25,112
I should not kind of like try to cling on
something. Um, I should be really fluid,

912
01:00:25,112 --> 01:00:29,952
like if I want to, uh, enjoy the world the
right way. Um,

913
01:00:30,732 --> 01:00:34,592
and so one of the stories in there, it
says,

914
01:00:35,352 --> 01:00:40,192
"If you're drowning and then you happen to
hug a log," like a big piece of wood.

915
01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:43,252
-Mm-hmm.
-"And then that has saved your life. Um,

916
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:43,762
but then

917
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:48,652
since you're now safe, you're, you're not
drowning anymore, you have come to the

918
01:00:48,692 --> 01:00:49,092
land.

919
01:00:49,932 --> 01:00:51,072
But maybe out of

920
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:56,312
security, you feel like this log is so
important for you, it has saved your life,

921
01:00:56,312 --> 01:01:02,168
so you just hug it to walk it."But who
knows your next quest is to climb the

922
01:01:02,168 --> 01:01:07,388
mountain. Like, you cannot... Since the
lock has saved you already, you should let

923
01:01:07,388 --> 01:01:11,748
it go because your next quest is climbing
a mountain. That lock is not going to

924
01:01:11,748 --> 01:01:13,087
-serve you.
-Hmm.

925
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:18,148
And so, that main guiding principle is
kind of like, say,

926
01:01:19,668 --> 01:01:26,428
everything is as is, as happened. Um, for
example, our podcast now

927
01:01:26,428 --> 01:01:28,008
-is as happened.
-Mm-hmm.

928
01:01:28,008 --> 01:01:32,328
It's going to end in, I don't know, like
20 minutes' time.

929
01:01:32,968 --> 01:01:33,648
And I should not

930
01:01:34,428 --> 01:01:35,468
-cling on it.
-Yeah.

931
01:01:35,468 --> 01:01:39,328
I should not think about, "Oh, damn, I
should change something about it."

932
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:42,837
-Hmm. I see.
-Like also in freelancing, it's like... Uh,

933
01:01:42,837 --> 01:01:49,368
in freelancing, you have to have a level
of grace, uh, and compassion to yourself

934
01:01:49,368 --> 01:01:53,968
for the courage to come out. If you
always said, "I have to be perfect. I

935
01:01:53,968 --> 01:01:57,668
cannot make any mistakes," sorry, you live
in a classroom. You're not living in the

936
01:01:57,668 --> 01:01:58,968
-real world.
-Hmm.

937
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:02,728
Um, if you are living in the real world
and you don't want to get to insanity

938
01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:05,868
[laughs], just try to

939
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:11,688
do a small experiment, see what it comes
back. And if it is not the outcome that

940
01:02:11,688 --> 01:02:14,468
you want, just pivot and do better next
time.

941
01:02:14,468 --> 01:02:17,848
-Yeah.
-So, like don't hug the lock when you have

942
01:02:17,848 --> 01:02:21,487
to climb the mountain. Yes, the lock has
saved you, it has served you in the past,

943
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:24,488
but time to move on.

944
01:02:25,968 --> 01:02:27,748
-Yeah. That-
-Yeah

945
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:30,388
... that's a, that's a great metaphor,
yeah.

946
01:02:30,388 --> 01:02:31,668
-Yeah, so it's kind of like-
-Mm-hmm

947
01:02:32,868 --> 01:02:37,868
... I don't see you, Nicola, as Nicola the
coachee, because I know

948
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:43,328
it just happened in this moment that we
met and I'm being put in a position to

949
01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:48,268
give you some advice, and you're in the
position of needing some advice. But this

950
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:52,808
is not forever. Like, this is not
permanent. At some point, these

951
01:02:54,028 --> 01:02:57,607
-three that I l- look after will grow.
-Mm-hmm.

952
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:01,888
Like, you're going to be a different
Nicola, and I don't see you, Nicola, as

953
01:03:01,888 --> 01:03:07,488
the first version anymore. Like, I should
see you as an ever-changing. And, eh, this

954
01:03:07,488 --> 01:03:11,968
is, this is the... This is what I think

955
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:16,538
the, the way that I prefer to look at
life. Everything.

956
01:03:16,538 --> 01:03:18,768
-Mm-hmm.
-Like people, person, environment,

957
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:23,668
-everything.
-Hmm. Makes me think of... It ki- I feel

958
01:03:23,668 --> 01:03:26,837
it's kind of a translation of this, um,

959
01:03:27,728 --> 01:03:34,067
that what serves, served you to, to get
here, will serve you to get-

960
01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:35,928
-Yeah
-... somewhere else, right? We have

961
01:03:35,928 --> 01:03:37,078
-different-
-Yeah

962
01:03:37,078 --> 01:03:42,828
... whatever, phases, challenges, uh,
growth path.

963
01:03:42,828 --> 01:03:45,428
-Mm.
-And something, you need something to

964
01:03:46,268 --> 01:03:51,828
get somewhere, eh, but then it won't help
you to get somewhere else because it's-

965
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,368
-Yeah
-... constantly evolving

966
01:03:54,008 --> 01:03:56,798
journey and challenges and, and stuff,
yeah.

967
01:03:58,288 --> 01:04:00,668
Perfect. This is a perfect interpretation.

968
01:04:00,668 --> 01:04:06,488
[laughs] Yeah. And what, what about the...
What was the, the third book that, that

969
01:04:06,488 --> 01:04:10,928
-you mentioned?
-The Way of Integrity by Marta Beck.

970
01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:15,828
Mm-hmm. And what's the, the message from
there, that one?

971
01:04:15,828 --> 01:04:19,248
The message is to really honor your own
truth.

972
01:04:19,248 --> 01:04:24,648
-Mm-hmm.
-And so, uh, it described like this theater

973
01:04:24,648 --> 01:04:27,328
play by... It's called Inferno.

974
01:04:28,108 --> 01:04:32,348
Um, so I think it's like, maybe it's
Italian story, you know? Like,

975
01:04:32,968 --> 01:04:36,697
-maybe let me know. [laughs]
-I'll, I'll look into it. I mean, the-

976
01:04:36,697 --> 01:04:39,768
-[laughs]
-... the Inferno from, from Dante is where

977
01:04:39,768 --> 01:04:41,248
-it all started.
-Yes.

978
01:04:41,248 --> 01:04:42,668
-Yeah.
-It's from Dante, yeah.

979
01:04:42,668 --> 01:04:47,028
-Mm-hmm.
-So, that book is about taking Dante's

980
01:04:47,028 --> 01:04:48,377
-Inferno-
-Oh, I see. I see

981
01:04:48,377 --> 01:04:51,428
-... into examining our life.
-Okay.

982
01:04:51,428 --> 01:04:56,908
And so, it says that it, it goes
through... You have to go through the

983
01:04:56,908 --> 01:04:59,368
-center of the Earth-
-Mm

984
01:04:59,368 --> 01:05:01,228
... and then go to the inferno

985
01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:07,127
and then coming out from the other side.
And so that book is such a-

986
01:05:07,127 --> 01:05:11,578
-Mm-hmm
-... supernova for me. Like- [laughs]

987
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:14,448
-Okay.
-Because, um,

988
01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:22,688
back then, I just take every advice as is
and thinking that if I apply them, um, I'm

989
01:05:22,688 --> 01:05:26,888
going to get success or get happier. But-

990
01:05:26,948 --> 01:05:30,228
-Mm
-... I forgot to examine myself, like if

991
01:05:30,228 --> 01:05:35,048
that advice is made for me or not. Like,
do I see myself in this or do I have a

992
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:36,108
level of understanding

993
01:05:37,587 --> 01:05:40,938
-that this thing fits me or not?
-Hmm.

994
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:41,317
Um,

995
01:05:42,008 --> 01:05:45,178
and the process of doing that is then to,

996
01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:47,948
to

997
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:48,317
-find-
-[laughs]

998
01:05:48,317 --> 01:05:53,788
... the truth slowly. And that book, The
Way of Integrity, it's basically like

999
01:05:54,408 --> 01:06:00,428
explaining or practicing or making you
realize what are the ways that you can

1000
01:06:00,428 --> 01:06:05,688
find your own integrity. And so you have
this inner truth as your anchor. And

1001
01:06:05,688 --> 01:06:07,508
everything has to filter through this,

1002
01:06:08,348 --> 01:06:11,228
and then you get a sense of clarity, um,

1003
01:06:12,248 --> 01:06:17,888
-when dealing with a lot of noise.
-I see. So it's like helping you

1004
01:06:17,888 --> 01:06:20,087
to, um,

1005
01:06:20,728 --> 01:06:23,648
filter the advice and whatever,
[clears throat]

1006
01:06:24,488 --> 01:06:26,127
whatever people tell you

1007
01:06:26,908 --> 01:06:31,127
instead of following, uh, everyone in all,
in every

1008
01:06:31,127 --> 01:06:36,337
-direction.
-Yeah. Yeah. It's more like

1009
01:06:37,408 --> 01:06:40,908
there are two kinds of heart. Um, there
are two kinds of

1010
01:06:42,028 --> 01:06:42,788
hardness,

1011
01:06:43,548 --> 01:06:46,868
um, that, that we face. Um,

1012
01:06:47,788 --> 01:06:52,627
one kind of heart is if you're a fish,
then if you want to swim to the ocean and

1013
01:06:52,627 --> 01:06:56,168
then, you know, it's a different
environment, you just have to push on,

1014
01:06:56,168 --> 01:07:00,308
right? Like you have a, you know, you'll
be stronger as a different, as a stronger

1015
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:04,308
fish. You'll maybe swim faster or
anything. But another kind of heart is you

1016
01:07:04,308 --> 01:07:06,998
don't know who you are, you don't even
know you're a fish-

1017
01:07:06,998 --> 01:07:08,648
-Yeah
-... and then you're trying to compete with

1018
01:07:08,648 --> 01:07:13,948
monkeys climbing the tree, and then
you'll be stuck thinking, "Why are the

1019
01:07:13,948 --> 01:07:19,652
other monkeys just seem so..."So light and
easy and so effortless in climbing the

1020
01:07:19,652 --> 01:07:23,851
trees, because you don't even know, like,
and, and you're kind of out of breath.

1021
01:07:23,852 --> 01:07:29,712
[laughs] You're not as good as they are.
You're not achieving the height that they

1022
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,492
-are, but you're half dying.
-Mm-hmm.

1023
01:07:32,492 --> 01:07:35,892
Uh, that's because you don't realize that
you're a fish. Like, this is not your

1024
01:07:35,892 --> 01:07:41,312
lane. Like, go back to the water, like,
and, and, you know, swim towards the

1025
01:07:41,312 --> 01:07:43,692
-ocean.
-Yeah.

1026
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,552
-Yeah.
-Did you, did you, um,

1027
01:07:46,652 --> 01:07:51,392
experience some- something like that?
There was, there was a time where you felt

1028
01:07:51,392 --> 01:07:53,292
-you were trying-
-Yeah

1029
01:07:54,412 --> 01:07:55,872
-... to do-
-Three times.

1030
01:07:55,872 --> 01:08:00,732
-Yeah? Okay.
-Three times that I have to be almost

1031
01:08:00,732 --> 01:08:03,401
bedridden [laughs], I'm in a lot of pain-

1032
01:08:04,072 --> 01:08:06,372
-Mm-hmm
-... uh, to realize, uh, I'm not supposed

1033
01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:11,212
to do a certain things, and usually that
comes in terms of, um,

1034
01:08:12,872 --> 01:08:14,492
the career choice,

1035
01:08:15,432 --> 01:08:16,652
-um-
-Mm-hmm

1036
01:08:16,652 --> 01:08:18,282
... and, uh, environment

1037
01:08:19,252 --> 01:08:21,562
and, uh, my

1038
01:08:22,992 --> 01:08:26,242
-attitude trying to climbing the trees-
-Hmm

1039
01:08:26,242 --> 01:08:29,902
... uh, while not knowing myself. So yeah,
I have had

1040
01:08:30,932 --> 01:08:37,262
three burnouts in the past 10 years, and
the first one was, um, during my software

1041
01:08:37,262 --> 01:08:44,152
engineering time, and the second one was
during my PhD time, and no...

1042
01:08:47,232 --> 01:08:51,512
During my, uh, data science consultant
time, and then third time was during my

1043
01:08:51,512 --> 01:08:55,392
-PhD time.
-Hmm.

1044
01:08:57,392 --> 01:08:59,412
And what did you real- realize?

1045
01:09:00,212 --> 01:09:03,052
Why you were, um... What

1046
01:09:04,592 --> 01:09:08,152
made it clear for you that you were doing
what you were

1047
01:09:09,152 --> 01:09:13,692
not supposed to do or was not?

1048
01:09:15,832 --> 01:09:19,012
I realized that

1049
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:24,012
I, I never think about checking in with
myself

1050
01:09:25,592 --> 01:09:26,121
if,

1051
01:09:28,072 --> 01:09:31,472
if being in an environment or doing a
certain thing

1052
01:09:32,212 --> 01:09:39,132
will make me respect myself more or less.
So I didn't... So it's more like I

1053
01:09:39,132 --> 01:09:39,952
keep looking out

1054
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,952
and I, I try doing things and I try to

1055
01:09:45,752 --> 01:09:49,662
come up with a good result, good
performance, um,

1056
01:09:51,112 --> 01:09:56,072
but then I don't know what I'm made of.
Um-

1057
01:09:56,792 --> 01:10:01,692
-Hmm.
-So it's kind of like... Uh, it's kind of

1058
01:10:01,692 --> 01:10:01,992
like

1059
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,832
I am trying my very best

1060
01:10:06,312 --> 01:10:11,852
just trying to survive instead of
thriving, and that comes in many, many

1061
01:10:11,852 --> 01:10:14,672
ways. Maybe it is with

1062
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:20,552
the pace of the project. Maybe it's with
the nature of the project. Maybe it's with

1063
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:27,512
the nature of the environment, of what is
demanded of you, um, and, and

1064
01:10:27,512 --> 01:10:32,342
this kind of, uh, self-awareness came,
uh,

1065
01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:39,772
after taking me through excruciating
physical pain, um, to, to

1066
01:10:39,772 --> 01:10:46,232
realize that maybe I should look at what
I'm made of. [laughs]

1067
01:10:46,852 --> 01:10:49,072
-Yeah.
-So you, you feel you were ignoring

1068
01:10:49,852 --> 01:10:50,272
maybe

1069
01:10:50,972 --> 01:10:54,732
earlier signals, right? You, you had to

1070
01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:59,012
-get to physical pain.
-I'm ignoring all the subtle and obvious

1071
01:10:59,012 --> 01:11:00,672
-signals-
-Mm-hmm

1072
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:04,712
... that until my body literally can't
move anymore,

1073
01:11:05,692 --> 01:11:07,772
-for me to say, "Stop."
-Okay.

1074
01:11:07,772 --> 01:11:11,492
Otherwise, I would still keep moving. Like
otherwise, I wouldn't have learned this

1075
01:11:11,492 --> 01:11:17,712
lesson. So my body was compassionate
enough to take a

1076
01:11:17,712 --> 01:11:23,862
breakdown, to remind myself that, hey,
this is not you. Like, this is

1077
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:30,432
... You're not... Uh, you're, you're,
you're a different vehicle being put on

1078
01:11:30,432 --> 01:11:31,432
-different purpose.
-Hmm.

1079
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:34,112
-Yeah.
-What, what are those signals

1080
01:11:34,752 --> 01:11:38,531
that someone in, in a similar situation
might catch before

1081
01:11:39,432 --> 01:11:40,052
getting to

1082
01:11:42,112 --> 01:11:42,792
-pain?
-Hmm.

1083
01:11:44,812 --> 01:11:46,592
At, at first, I would say

1084
01:11:47,592 --> 01:11:53,472
it is, um, little discomfort here and
there, and that might come in terms of

1085
01:11:53,472 --> 01:12:00,252
emotions, that might comes in terms of
sensations. Um, and then, uh, the

1086
01:12:00,252 --> 01:12:03,672
next thing would be you're trying to
overcome them-

1087
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:04,372
-Mm-hmm
-... but

1088
01:12:05,012 --> 01:12:09,832
you feel that you are slowly giving up on
yourself or betraying yourself. Like,

1089
01:12:09,832 --> 01:12:10,992
you're, you're so

1090
01:12:11,752 --> 01:12:15,092
kind of like betraying your own truth, um,

1091
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:19,942
in order to get better, if that make any
sense. Um,

1092
01:12:21,492 --> 01:12:23,012
and then you

1093
01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:23,872
keep

1094
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:26,792
giving in. So

1095
01:12:27,872 --> 01:12:30,112
-you slowly find yourself-
-Mm-hmm

1096
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:33,672
... grinding

1097
01:12:35,492 --> 01:12:36,312
more like,

1098
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:42,112
more like you, more like you feel like you
grind yourself off, that nothing is left.

1099
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:47,712
Like you're, you're le- you're slowly
losing your life force instead of, um,

1100
01:12:48,192 --> 01:12:49,652
instead of feeling like,

1101
01:12:50,892 --> 01:12:54,672
-"I'm still myself doing this."
-Hmm.

1102
01:12:54,672 --> 01:13:00,232
Yeah. It, it's going to feel like, "I keep
running and running and running, but for

1103
01:13:00,232 --> 01:13:05,472
what?" And maybe your logical brain is
going to convince you, "Ah, it's for

1104
01:13:05,472 --> 01:13:07,222
-this," you know, the-
-Hmm

1105
01:13:07,222 --> 01:13:08,522
... this, um,

1106
01:13:09,912 --> 01:13:11,672
nice achievement,

1107
01:13:12,452 --> 01:13:16,832
and it's for me to prove to myself that I
can do this,

1108
01:13:16,832 --> 01:13:21,023
um-But yeah, um,

1109
01:13:21,684 --> 01:13:28,224
this is going to... This is kind of like a
slippery slope where you, you betray

1110
01:13:28,224 --> 01:13:32,983
-yourself again and again and again. Yeah.
-Yeah. And y-

1111
01:13:32,983 --> 01:13:35,943
-Those are the signs.
-Yeah, definitely.

1112
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,724
-It happened to me-
-Those are the signs. And then you, you

1113
01:13:38,724 --> 01:13:40,214
-wake up and then you think like-
-Mm-hmm

1114
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:40,214
...

1115
01:13:41,044 --> 01:13:44,224
"Why am I doing this?" Like, like, "Where
am I?" [laughs]

1116
01:13:44,224 --> 01:13:47,264
Yeah, exactly. Wanted to say exactly the
same.

1117
01:13:47,264 --> 01:13:48,124
-[laughs]
-But

1118
01:13:48,764 --> 01:13:50,784
it happened to me in the, in the past
going

1119
01:13:52,103 --> 01:13:53,523
into work in the morning,

1120
01:13:55,284 --> 01:14:02,112
you know. You, you get there, you sit at
your desk, you look around and you say,

1121
01:14:02,112 --> 01:14:06,334
-"What am I doing here?"
-[laughs] Yeah.

1122
01:14:06,334 --> 01:14:07,884
-[laughs]
-Time to look inside.

1123
01:14:07,884 --> 01:14:11,264
-Yeah.
-That's a message for you. Read the

1124
01:14:11,264 --> 01:14:17,603
-message. [laughs]
-I see. And so you... It's

1125
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:23,404
interesting, you, you, you said that this
happened to you, um, three times. So it

1126
01:14:23,404 --> 01:14:27,964
was different things that you discovered,
or you went,

1127
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:35,824
you went back to, uh, something similar
that, I don't know, uh, catch you

1128
01:14:35,824 --> 01:14:37,784
in a different way?

1129
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:43,504
Same feeling, different environment,

1130
01:14:43,504 --> 01:14:49,634
different faces, different projects. But
the feeling is the same.

1131
01:14:49,634 --> 01:14:50,824
-Okay.
-The feeling is that

1132
01:14:52,464 --> 01:14:53,864
I didn't stop myself right there

1133
01:14:55,563 --> 01:15:02,044
and allow myself to do the things or be
somewhere or... well, generally do

1134
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:02,454
something

1135
01:15:03,084 --> 01:15:07,844
that make myself respect me less.

1136
01:15:08,964 --> 01:15:12,044
-Hmm.
-That's the, that the... That's the

1137
01:15:12,044 --> 01:15:14,063
question that I didn't think of

1138
01:15:14,744 --> 01:15:17,964
questioning myself back then, if this
would be my

1139
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:24,364
decision filtering process that will make
a lot of life easier.

1140
01:15:24,364 --> 01:15:28,084
I see. And there, there were... There was
a part of you

1141
01:15:29,702 --> 01:15:32,864
in the second or third time that says

1142
01:15:35,724 --> 01:15:38,483
why you, you felt again into this

1143
01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:44,304
-or, or not?
-No, second and third time I managed to

1144
01:15:44,304 --> 01:15:46,264
-catch myself easier.
-Okay.

1145
01:15:46,264 --> 01:15:51,044
Um, and being different from the first
time. The first time is kind of like I

1146
01:15:51,044 --> 01:15:55,574
just graduated university, this is my very
first job. I have to do my very best as a

1147
01:15:55,574 --> 01:15:57,554
-A+ student. [laughs]
-Mm-hmm.

1148
01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:58,603
You know, like

1149
01:15:59,324 --> 01:16:02,954
score perfectly, uh, for everything that I
do.

1150
01:16:02,954 --> 01:16:06,684
-Yeah.
-Um, when I had the first burnout, I

1151
01:16:06,684 --> 01:16:10,813
actually doubted myself. Like, I actually
asked myself, like, "Why am I so useless?"

1152
01:16:10,813 --> 01:16:12,964
-Like, "Why can't I do this?"
-Yes.

1153
01:16:12,964 --> 01:16:13,114
Um,

1154
01:16:13,844 --> 01:16:17,364
but second and third time, no. Like second
and third time it's like, "Ah, there it

1155
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:22,344
goes again." [laughs] "I thought I have
pivoted, but looks like I have not pivoted

1156
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:26,244
-enough." [laughs]
-[laughs] I see. Okay.

1157
01:16:26,244 --> 01:16:31,154
-Yeah.
-That makes sense. There, there was some...

1158
01:16:31,154 --> 01:16:36,464
You feel external pressure, and
especially in the first time or something

1159
01:16:36,464 --> 01:16:40,164
that you, um,

1160
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:48,764
that it was coming from, from the past or
something that you learned when, when you

1161
01:16:48,764 --> 01:16:55,724
were younger, um, that you needed to be
this A+ student, uh, score everything

1162
01:16:55,724 --> 01:16:58,233
-at, uh, the best-
-Hmm

1163
01:16:58,233 --> 01:17:02,884
... you felt like some external pressure
back then?

1164
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:09,014
I wouldn't think it's an external
pressure. I think it is more like the...

1165
01:17:10,904 --> 01:17:14,084
-I misunderstood myself.
-Hmm.

1166
01:17:14,084 --> 01:17:19,744
Um, only recently, two to three years ago,
that

1167
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:24,603
I change my perspective

1168
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,044
on my existence in the world.

1169
01:17:28,204 --> 01:17:28,603
So

1170
01:17:30,544 --> 01:17:32,884
only up until two to three years

1171
01:17:34,204 --> 01:17:34,724
ago,

1172
01:17:36,044 --> 01:17:38,924
I used to think that my existence

1173
01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:42,404
is to be of use by others,

1174
01:17:43,304 --> 01:17:44,103
is to

1175
01:17:45,103 --> 01:17:45,943
lose my

1176
01:17:46,664 --> 01:17:47,924
shapes and forms

1177
01:17:48,784 --> 01:17:51,523
and then putting myself down to the dust

1178
01:17:52,603 --> 01:17:56,284
and to just serve others, and that is
love.

1179
01:17:56,284 --> 01:18:00,344
-Hmm. Okay.
-And that is contribution. That was my

1180
01:18:00,344 --> 01:18:00,844
thinking-

1181
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:04,704
-Mm-hmm
-... back then. Um,

1182
01:18:05,624 --> 01:18:06,144
and yeah,

1183
01:18:07,124 --> 01:18:12,664
well since this last two to three years,
I've changed a lot. [laughs] I'm living a

1184
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:17,404
much better life right now, uh, and
continue to do better. But yeah,

1185
01:18:18,124 --> 01:18:20,164
um, that, that, that

1186
01:18:21,664 --> 01:18:22,964
shift in perspective

1187
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:30,244
that I am my own person, I have my shapes
and forms and boundaries. This is where I

1188
01:18:30,244 --> 01:18:36,443
end, this is where other start. [laughs]
Uh, I can have my own preference. Uh,

1189
01:18:37,124 --> 01:18:37,364
I

1190
01:18:38,364 --> 01:18:40,584
exist in the world, therefore

1191
01:18:41,624 --> 01:18:46,084
I have the right to interact with the
world as me.

1192
01:18:46,084 --> 01:18:48,603
-Mm-hmm.
-Um, that might sound crazy for a lot of

1193
01:18:48,603 --> 01:18:53,844
people hearing this right now, but this is
seriously... If I want to be totally

1194
01:18:53,844 --> 01:18:58,044
honest, I only s- started

1195
01:18:58,924 --> 01:19:02,103
embodying that two to three years ago.

1196
01:19:03,344 --> 01:19:10,044
Yeah. I, I think it... most people are,
are struggling with that. Is, is not, not

1197
01:19:10,044 --> 01:19:11,144
strange. Or maybe

1198
01:19:12,103 --> 01:19:15,643
it's strange for someone because they have
not thought about it.

1199
01:19:15,644 --> 01:19:16,494
-Hmm.
-But, uh,

1200
01:19:18,144 --> 01:19:19,824
-many, many people-
-I'm not going back. I'm-

1201
01:19:19,824 --> 01:19:22,804
-Yeah.
-It's irreversible anymore. [laughs] I'm

1202
01:19:22,804 --> 01:19:26,824
-not going back. Never ever.
-Of course not, yeah.

1203
01:19:27,932 --> 01:19:28,192
-[laughs]
-No

1204
01:19:29,092 --> 01:19:32,212
-way.
-Yeah. That's, uh, yeah. That's amazing

1205
01:19:32,212 --> 01:19:32,862
that, that

1206
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:38,392
you have been able to, to do that, you
know. It takes,

1207
01:19:40,052 --> 01:19:44,032
it takes, um... Some people, it takes a
lot of time and-

1208
01:19:44,032 --> 01:19:44,192
Mm-hmm

1209
01:19:45,192 --> 01:19:48,012
... you don't even realize because when,
when

1210
01:19:48,772 --> 01:19:53,132
the past you, uh, were not realizing, was
not realizing

1211
01:19:53,751 --> 01:19:58,032
what was happening, right? Uh, or not
fully,

1212
01:19:58,772 --> 01:19:59,172
-uh-
-Mm-hmm

1213
01:19:59,172 --> 01:20:05,412
... to be able to, to break out of it and,
as you said, understand your boundaries

1214
01:20:05,412 --> 01:20:05,882
and that

1215
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:13,892
you exist for yourself with your own
tastes and goals, et cetera, et cetera.

1216
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:17,432
-Yeah.
-You're not living just for the others. And

1217
01:20:17,432 --> 01:20:18,972
it's amazing to see you

1218
01:20:19,592 --> 01:20:21,072
-shine now.
-[laughs]

1219
01:20:21,072 --> 01:20:22,132
I'm, I'm so curious to,

1220
01:20:22,992 --> 01:20:24,552
to see where this

1221
01:20:25,332 --> 01:20:30,612
-path will, will lead y- lead you.
-Mm-hmm.

1222
01:20:30,612 --> 01:20:31,302
-I would want-
-Yeah

1223
01:20:31,302 --> 01:20:33,032
... you to share more of this because

1224
01:20:33,692 --> 01:20:34,332
-it's-
-[sighs]

1225
01:20:34,332 --> 01:20:39,872
It's so important and you, you explain in
such easy and understandable

1226
01:20:39,872 --> 01:20:43,772
-terms.
-Sure. We'll be glad to.

1227
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:46,272
-Share.
-We'll be glad to. Let's see how things go,

1228
01:20:46,272 --> 01:20:47,082
-but-
-Okay

1229
01:20:47,082 --> 01:20:49,942
... I'm feeling hopeful. I'm feeling very
hopeful. [laughs]

1230
01:20:49,942 --> 01:20:51,112
[laughs] I know.

1231
01:20:51,892 --> 01:20:57,692
That's great. Okay. I think that this is,
um, a nice

1232
01:20:57,692 --> 01:20:59,642
-ending.
-That's great.

1233
01:20:59,642 --> 01:21:02,912
Thank you so much, Hui, for, for the
conversation.

1234
01:21:02,912 --> 01:21:06,172
-Thanks for having me.
-I learned a bit more about you and, uh,

1235
01:21:06,172 --> 01:21:09,492
you have shared so many interesting
things. I hope people can,

1236
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:11,872
um, use them

1237
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:13,172
to,

1238
01:21:14,092 --> 01:21:16,712
to grow them, themselves as well.

1239
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:23,072
Yeah. Really, Nicola, thank you so much
for inviting me to do this. Uh, I am not

1240
01:21:23,072 --> 01:21:27,572
used to talk about myself. I hope this
ends well. But in any case, I've enjoyed

1241
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:31,852
our conversation today and, uh, thank you
for having me.

1242
01:21:31,852 --> 01:21:33,172
-Thank you, Hui.
-Thank you.

1243
01:21:33,172 --> 01:21:38,112
Bye. See you.
