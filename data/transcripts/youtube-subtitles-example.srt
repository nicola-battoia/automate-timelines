1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
One kind of hard is if you're a fish

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,319
then if you want to swim to the ocean

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,559
and then you know like it's a different

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,639
environment you just have to push on

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,639
right like you have a you know you be

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,880
stronger as a different as a stronger

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,880
fish you maybe swim faster or anything

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
but another kind of heart is you don't

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
know who you are you don't even know

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,039
you're a fish and then you're trying to

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,640
compete with monkeys climbing the tree

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,920
and and you're kind of out of breath

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,439
you're not as good as they are and my

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
2008

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,559
high school self just got like blown

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,200
away. That person replied that says you

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,280
should just go for computer science. And

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,160
I'm like whoever that is, thank you so

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,440
much. You're one of the reason why I'm

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,160
here today uh as a data scientist and a

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,879
engineer in 2025.

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,039
Especially in the work that I do for

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,399
clients right now. Intention really

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,160
matters and what problems are you

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,280
solving and for who humans have to come

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,400
up with this first and foremost and then

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,640
the tech comes in. There's a guy who is

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,600
so convinced that he is a mushroom. He's

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
not a human. And so he just take this

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,400
umbrella and then just stood on one side

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,799
all along. And so one day a person comes

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,119
along just take another umbrella and

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,320
just sit next to him.

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,080
And then that mushroom guy said, "Hey,

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,320
what are you doing here?" And then that

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,799
guy just says like, "I'm also a

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,799
mushroom." That guy says, "Huh? Oh,

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,960
we're mushroom friends now." And then

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,000
after you know sitting sitting with that

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:43,200
guy for for some time that that guy just

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,880
started to stand and walk

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,200
and then the mushroom man just freaked

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,680
out. Hey you're a mushroom. How can you

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,560
do this? You don't know it's 2025.

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,520
Mushrooms can walk. Huh? Interesting.

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,520
Are you okay? Mushroom can walk. And he

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,079
said of course all mushrooms can walk

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,479
this year. Starting this year. And then

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,280
that mushroom guy just stand up. And the

50
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:09,920
moral of the story is I don't have to be

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,319
right. I just have to try my best to

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,790
have the intention to get this person

53
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,810
into where they want to go.

54
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,810
[Music]

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,640
Hi Way, thank you so much for for doing

56
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,120
this. I took this chance to to learn a

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,760
bit more about you.

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,239
uh because I think that you have very

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,319
cool things to to share.

60
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,319
Let's hope so. Thanks for having me and

61
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,400
I really look forward to our good

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,560
conversation today.

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,760
Cool. Amazing. So, let's get started. Uh

64
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,519
you were you were sharing the most

65
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,400
amazing stories. So, I

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,160
I'll go from from there because there is

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,760
uh some magic there. So yeah before that

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,400
maybe uh brief introduction of what we

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,440
might touch on. We know each other from

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,239
the program data freelancer

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,840
where where you have helped people to

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,959
get started in the their data and AI

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,080
freelance journey and I was curious um

74
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,720
preparing for for this interview uh

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,599
where all these started. I think there's

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,800
always interesting stories there. Well,

77
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,519
your question make me like um kind of

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,120
like rewind to many many years ago. Uh I

79
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,599
just like graduated from high school and

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,400
uh to be honest, I'm I'm like not very

81
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,000
techsavvy at that time. Like I just I

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,080
just learned how to use the internet for

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,959
like the second or the third year. Um

84
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,879
uh and then um I came across this thing

85
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,599
called YouTube and then uh for some

86
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:59,680
divine intervention I just watched the

87
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,760
Microsoft vision 2020 video. So that was

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:07,200
like you can imagine like I mean we are

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:11,840
now in 2025. Uh but I was watching like

90
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:18,560
a a video of what Microsoft envisioned

91
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:20,959
2020 to be in 20 in in 2008. So,

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,840
and my 2008

93
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:28,080
high school self just got like blown

94
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,000
away uh with that video because it is

95
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,479
you know it starts with like you can

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,240
communicate with uh people in another

97
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,520
country. It's auto translated and then

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,160
uh there's this like you know like

99
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,440
transparent glass panel with text

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,520
popping up like oh your your your things

101
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,479
is done oh this person has this update

102
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,000
you'd see dashboard and everything

103
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
at that time it was just like

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,560
unfathomable

105
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,759
and so out of curiosity because I was

106
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,000
like like too was still amazed uh with

107
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:07,440
that thing I commented under the video

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,720
uh and says like uh wow this is such a

109
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,440
great video. I am a high school graduate

110
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,240
uh trying to figure out what should I

111
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,880
study for university. Can anybody tell

112
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,759
me what should I study in a university

113
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,360
just to be a part of this magic? And

114
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:30,960
then a stranger of a stranger in

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,720
internet whoever sees this comment um

116
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
that person replied that says you should

117
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,840
just go for computer science and I'm

118
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,479
like whoever that is thank you so much

119
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,440
you're one of the reason why I'm here

120
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,160
today uh as a data scientist and a

121
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,560
engineer in 2025

122
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,039
we need we all need to thank that that

123
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,520
YouTube commenter the magic on YouTube.

124
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,759
A gesture of kindness. Yeah. So it's

125
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,160
sparked by inspiration really

126
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,440
of magic making.

127
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,520
Okay. So from from there you you started

128
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:11,039
the traditional path of computer science

129
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:15,680
actually software engineering. So um

130
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:18,960
so at that time I was living in a small

131
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,759
town that is like 4 hours away from the

132
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,039
capital city. um of Malaysia, Koala

133
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:30,400
Lumpur. And so I picked one university

134
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:32,800
to go and study. Um but uh so you know

135
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,960
like at that time you do foundation in

136
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,319
IT and after one year um I I was going

137
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,080
to like computer science but then uh the

138
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
the school admission says hey you are

139
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,160
the only one who registered for computer

140
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
science do you mind like changing a

141
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
course?

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,919
And so I changed. Yeah. And so I changed

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,440
to software engineering. Um actually

144
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,280
software engineering with m with

145
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,319
multimedia. And so in that four years

146
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,720
um a fascinating tech came out which is

147
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,120
called uh AR and VR. So augmented

148
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,520
reality and virtual reality. And so me

149
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,360
and my friends we were just uh involved

150
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,319
in um like

151
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,880
just projects using augmented reality

152
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,000
and then we participated in you know

153
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,199
like Microsoft imagine cup and things

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,319
like this. Yeah. So that was bachelor's

155
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,919
time. Good time it's been some time.

156
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,919
Cool. And and then how because now you

157
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,720
are you're not in Malaysia anymore,

158
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,120
right?

159
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,639
Yes.

160
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,880
10 years. 10 years in Germany now.

161
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,160
Okay. And how how do you like Germany?

162
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
It's great.

163
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,919
Mhm.

164
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,240
I just saw one of the first Christmas

165
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,520
Christmas market booths

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,280
today that's getting set up. So yeah,

167
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,360
Christmas market is one of the things

168
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,039
that I look forward each year in

169
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,039
Germany. But yeah, Germany is for this

170
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,199
10 years. I think uh I really have to

171
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,720
thank this country for it because it

172
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,080
really

173
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,000
um grows me as a person. I feel like I I

174
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
feel like I've I've grown a lot in this

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,639
last 10 years

176
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,440
really. Okay. And you think uh that

177
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,560
Germany help you to to to grow

178
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,280
personally in in which way? M yeah I

179
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,919
would say fundamentally um because you

180
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,639
know like I I've basically uprooted

181
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,800
myself in one culture, one country, one

182
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,599
environment and then being put into like

183
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,680
such a different environment. And so I

184
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,159
think the greatest things that Germany

185
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:46,000
has made space for me is to

186
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,480
is to know who I am as a person, what I

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,720
prefer, what my thoughts and preferences

188
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,440
are and what do I want and then I can go

189
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,519
towards that. And so I would say in

190
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,279
general like this um individual

191
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,320
individuation

192
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,200
uh this is what uh Germany has given me

193
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,680
space to grow into.

194
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,720
Cool. Yeah. I I've lived in Germany as

195
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,760
well and I I think there are some some

196
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,959
very traditional aspects of of German

197
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,760
culture

198
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,279
but also there is um a big part of

199
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,000
letting

200
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:28,160
everyone be who they want to be

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,240
in all weird ways. they they accept and

202
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,760
are very

203
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,440
very particular you know and there is

204
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,519
not not that much judgment around that

205
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,720
compared to to other countries or other

206
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,920
cultures you know

207
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,440
yeah that's right and so like I I think

208
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,000
this is the the right place um that I'm

209
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,480
being put in to actually grow as a

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,480
person like I know I am not anybody's

211
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,320
shadow this way I'm just me Okay, cool.

212
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,120
I I I remember that you you shared with

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,240
me some some time ago that that maybe

214
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,720
you realized a few a few changes when

215
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,959
when you went back to to Malaysia after

216
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,560
after some time, right?

217
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,800
I mean, this happened to me as well when

218
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,240
I go back to my hometown, home own

219
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,480
place. After sometimes I realized I'm

220
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm I'm not anymore the person was that

221
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,800
was living there and uh I cannot fit

222
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,880
anymore in that place because I grown in

223
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,519
different ways. Right.

224
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,800
Yeah. I think no matter where you go, if

225
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,800
you are an expat, um you feel like the

226
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,760
version of home that you that that you

227
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,600
were familiar with, but you leave um

228
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,320
will just be a snapshot in the past

229
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,519
because I mean Malaysia has grown so

230
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:53,440
much in these recent years. And so I

231
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:57,760
think as an expat no matter where you go

232
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:02,480
um you feel like you never belong in the

233
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:05,040
place that um you grow into but you're

234
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,040
also never home anymore because home as

235
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,079
has also evolved but I don't think that

236
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,760
is I don't think there's any issue with

237
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,560
that because this is the path that

238
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,800
all of us experts have chosen.

239
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,920
And what's most important is to

240
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,600
as long as you are feeling you uh and as

241
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,720
long as you're living authentically,

242
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,680
home is where you are. Home is not the

243
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,680
snapshot that you left alone with. Home

244
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,480
is also not like you don't necessarily

245
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,760
feel like 100% fitting in uh into

246
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,800
anything. But I am pretty sure like a

247
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,120
lot of locals will also share that uh

248
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,360
maybe they also don't feel like they fit

249
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,519
into the place that they have been like

250
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,560
growing up in.

251
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,800
So I think essentially

252
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,640
having this

253
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:06,000
having this experience just teach us

254
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,480
to realize that to realize that home is

255
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,519
really where you are.

256
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,720
Yeah, that's that's that's the goal,

257
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,079
right? I mean to to build your own where

258
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,279
where you are, be be good with with you,

259
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,240
which is a journey in in itself, I I

260
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,959
guess.

261
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,839
Yeah.

262
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,839
Yeah.

263
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:31,680
Interesting.

264
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:34,320
And where where in all this um AI fits?

265
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Oh, okay. where what did we where what

266
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,360
where did we uh have the story last

267
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,079
time? Yeah, software engineering and I

268
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,760
came to Germany to study um intelligent

269
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,959
adaptive systems. So I started my

270
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:54,959
masters in the University of Hamburg in

271
00:12:48,959 --> 00:13:00,639
2015 so 10 years ago. Um yeah so uh that

272
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:03,760
is um that three years uh is such a

273
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,600
eyeopener because that's when I really

274
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,480
learn the ins and outs like hardcore

275
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,200
research and application of machine

276
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,240
learning deep learning. I was working on

277
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,560
this uh humanoid robotics projects and

278
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,279
some sensors, you know, pairing that

279
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,760
with machine learning and training

280
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,920
humanoid robotics and doing computer

281
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,760
vision and all that.

282
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,800
What What do you think of uh the last um

283
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,800
humanoid robot thing that um came out

284
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:40,720
last week? I think this to me weird

285
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,279
robot with a with a sweater that

286
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,760
you know the Neo Neo I think it's called

287
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,680
the Neo something.

288
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,639
Yeah, I wouldn't give up things but the

289
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,040
the the humanoid robot uh the humanoid

290
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,839
robot that I was working on

291
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,920
uh also starts with N.

292
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,839
Okay.

293
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,760
Interesting.

294
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:07,680
Yeah. um you you guys sort of share very

295
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,600
similar names. Um but then

296
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,480
when I think about that version of the

297
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:18,240
robot with this version, I think

298
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,199
it it it needs some

299
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,920
maybe give it five more years uh for

300
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,880
another breakthrough. Um I think it's

301
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,279
more like maybe humanoid robotic is

302
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,519
developing a little bit you know needing

303
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,519
it is needing more time for all the

304
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,079
undeterministic

305
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,199
situations undeterministic scenarios in

306
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,839
real life. Um

307
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,839
so I feel that

308
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,040
yeah u

309
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,320
it takes much more time than than people

310
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,199
expect right

311
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,720
yeah but I think it's also the the the

312
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,800
perception the audience perception of it

313
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,440
because humanoid robotics is can it can

314
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,560
be borderline like uncanny you know and

315
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,680
so

316
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,240
and so the the mode of presentation has

317
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,399
to be a little bit careful because

318
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,320
if you if you present things like hey

319
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,639
you have a person that is maneuvering

320
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,480
the robot which means like what about

321
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:22,079
the privacy like I I um

322
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,399
that that's definitely unexpected.

323
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,320
Yeah.

324
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,600
Yeah. But I think that is the safest way

325
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
for the team

326
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,519
to actually

327
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,560
um

328
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,360
in a in a more controllable way

329
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,279
ensuring the accuracy of the humanoid

330
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,959
robot. And so I would give it some

331
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:44,720
grace, but I also totally understand how

332
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:48,399
uncanny it can feel when

333
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,600
when us just put ourself in the shoes of

334
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,199
the consumer of the user and then

335
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,680
extrapolate this presentation into what

336
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,839
might be in the future. Um, so yeah, if

337
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,639
you're if anybody is thinking about, you

338
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,800
know, [ __ ] the future is doom, I can

339
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,199
totally understand. Like this is just a

340
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,040
I think the handling of the presentation

341
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:17,680
into what the audience might feel like

342
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:21,120
that that that can be more considerate.

343
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,839
Yeah. But because the the the end goal I

344
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,560
mean not not everyone will will see it

345
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,000
the same way but most people would love

346
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:33,120
to have someone if it is a robot it's

347
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,600
fine to that do all the household stuff

348
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,759
for you right that that that is great

349
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,880
but it's I feel the technology will need

350
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,079
more time than than expected even if

351
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,720
Elon Musk I think will is saying that in

352
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,360
the next few years we'll be there in

353
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,240
every something like that. But you have

354
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,279
been working for example um on these

355
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:02,639
from 2015 right and you you think uh it

356
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:07,439
has advanced a lot in these 10 years or

357
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,720
it's a long incremental journey.

358
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,959
I don't think it's going to be

359
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,839
incremental. I think it's going to be

360
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,880
exponential uh from the rate of

361
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,520
development. Um

362
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:25,360
I think it still depends on how the

363
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:30,720
world is moving and being somebody who

364
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,880
have worked briefly um in human robotics

365
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,880
afterwards. I mean I have some years in

366
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,440
research um also in synthetic patient

367
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,120
data generation field.

368
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,200
What I think is I can almost hear two

369
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,000
sides of things. um one is the voice of

370
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,960
the rest of the world who are not in the

371
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
research and who are not in the work uh

372
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,280
having to apply it. Their their concern

373
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is real

374
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,000
and so that should not be ignored. That

375
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:09,120
should be leaned in and listened to. It

376
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,880
has to be a dialogue um for how this um

377
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,039
for how this can be done in a way that

378
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,280
essentially is affecting everybody to be

379
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:23,280
honest. Um and people like voices from

380
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:26,880
all sides has to be considered. Um

381
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,280
but then on the other hand um for us who

382
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,200
are the practitioners of the field of

383
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,760
the tech

384
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,000
I see a lot of possibilities. I see a

385
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,480
lot of values to be done. Um especially

386
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,960
in the work that I do for clients right

387
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:48,559
now. Um what I see is

388
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,200
intention really matters and

389
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,120
what problems are you solving and for

390
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,640
who?

391
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,880
um humans have to come up with this

392
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,039
first and foremost and then the tech

393
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:06,960
comes in to you know make it make it

394
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:11,360
happen in reality. And so I think what

395
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,600
we can control right now is whoever is

396
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,039
needing this solution and whoever like

397
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:21,360
us is executing or implementing the

398
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:26,240
solutions figuring out for what and for

399
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:29,200
who. it's kind of our due diligence. Um,

400
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,799
and when it's done right, I do see a lot

401
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,760
of possibilities uh with the current LM

402
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:40,640
advancements. Uh, and it's just like the

403
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:43,280
the the the general um, you know, Gen AI

404
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,679
feel how it's evolving. Uh, it it is

405
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,600
really fascinating.

406
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,520
Yeah. I mean, we we of course share this

407
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,280
fascination, right? because we see all

408
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,880
the possibilities.

409
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,919
Um, but in the in the last years as this

410
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,480
has become an universal phenomenon and

411
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,280
everybody is is talking about generative

412
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,440
AI and all this stuff, there are all

413
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:14,320
sorts of of voices and things going on.

414
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:17,520
Uh people are scared or are um thoughts

415
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,039
around you know all these things. AGI

416
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,440
will will take um many jobs and

417
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,640
political things going on. So it's it's

418
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,520
a mess, right? We we enjoy it because we

419
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,880
we like to build things. I think that's

420
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:37,360
that's the spirit and we see it's just a

421
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:40,480
as a technology, right? Um but most

422
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:44,159
people which are not into this will hear

423
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,919
the news, hear whatever and understand

424
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,840
what they what they can with with the

425
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,159
information that they have. So there is

426
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:57,679
definitely a bridge there uh to to there

427
00:20:52,159 --> 00:21:01,679
is a gap to to to fill between these two

428
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,480
uh words right and um yeah I guess as

429
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,720
you were saying it's it's important to

430
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,919
to pick the the right things uh in a way

431
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,039
um do it well but also communicate it in

432
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,520
in in the right way uh so that people

433
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,120
understand and don't have a weird

434
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,760
expectation or fears, you know, is that

435
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,000
something that that that you fe that the

436
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,159
that you feel uh when when you work with

437
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,640
with clients or uh interact with uh less

438
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,159
technical people?

439
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,600
You mean uh when deal when communicating

440
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:44,080
with less technical clients?

441
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Um, am I understanding correctly that do

442
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,480
you think I feel that they care about

443
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,559
the for what and for who or how should I

444
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,640
how should I understand your question?

445
00:21:52,559 --> 00:22:00,960
Yeah, if if you you feel that there is

446
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,240
um a disconnection between um how you

447
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,880
see this technology and what uh less

448
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,799
technical people expect from the

449
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:15,440
technology or what they uh think about

450
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:18,799
it if they have fears or

451
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,000
um how do you say yeah

452
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,919
for the clients I I come across usually

453
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,159
Um,

454
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,000
usually it is not like I go and pitch

455
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,520
that they need a solution. It's more

456
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,440
like they come to me that says they need

457
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,120
a solution. And so I would say in my

458
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,000
biased

459
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,679
small sample size experience

460
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,600
um there's less fear when a client comes

461
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,679
to me and said they need a certain

462
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,840
solution to be made. Um there can be you

463
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,120
know the application of machine learning

464
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,080
or even like statistics um like

465
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,799
traditional uh data insights,

466
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,360
predictive modeling or the bridge of

467
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,000
like taking predictive modeling insights

468
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,440
and then pair that with

469
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,720
um LM generation based on this insights.

470
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,520
Um but usually when they come to me they

471
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,960
already know what they want but then

472
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,840
it's up to us to say okay what is the

473
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,640
best way to go about it

474
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,280
do we care enough for the project to

475
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,760
carry on a good work for the client is

476
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,000
the for what and for who aligned with

477
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,559
the implement as well it's like do I

478
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,480
feel proud to put this piece of project

479
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,880
in my portfolio

480
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,679
uh I think this is then regarding the

481
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,919
fit

482
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,919
And if it doesn't fit, just feel free

483
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,159
to, you know, uh, politely excuse

484
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,919
yourself of this opportunity.

485
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,159
Uh, but then, um, what I am striving for

486
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,159
is

487
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:57,120
try to do things that

488
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,120
that are for good because this is part

489
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,600
of my values,

490
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,520
but for good is also kind of like, hey,

491
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,039
it's it can be anything. Um,

492
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,640
yeah.

493
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:11,200
But for me, it's kind of like

494
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,840
something that I told told a lot of our

495
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,919
members, our community members, is when

496
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,679
you look back at the things that you do,

497
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,200
even as a freelancer, content creator,

498
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:24,799
or whatnot, um it's okay to feel cringe,

499
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,400
but you don't really want to feel shame.

500
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,320
And so, it's kind of like

501
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,880
intention matters.

502
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,120
Okay. So what's what's an example of

503
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,480
something that you have been you have

504
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,919
worked on that you are proud of it?

505
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,960
Quite many.

506
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:45,600
So right now I am developing

507
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:48,480
a an automated tool for a consumer goods

508
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,159
company to

509
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,200
help their data scientists come up with

510
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:57,039
stability tests. So basically stability

511
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,440
test is like um you know when consumer

512
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,279
goods have a expiry date they have to

513
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,440
really like test their products over

514
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:09,360
some time and then use some algorithm to

515
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:11,039
come up with um expiry date. So to me I

516
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,760
feel like this is a meaningful project

517
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,760
because I get to save the data scientist

518
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,840
time who come up with expiry date for

519
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,720
consumer goods which these consumer

520
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,080
goods will be used by many many people.

521
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:31,120
And then another project that I help uh

522
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:34,960
to do is um the the pollutants

523
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:39,039
monitoring of the rin water uh system.

524
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,440
So basically like um basically like part

525
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:46,559
of Germany and the Netherlands share the

526
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:50,720
same water system and then um I helped

527
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:55,919
build sort of like a predictive modeling

528
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:58,559
tool to kind of like say hey can we you

529
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,799
know it's all sparse data so and then

530
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,240
data is kind of like inconsistent and

531
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,039
everything so a lot of processing is

532
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:10,159
involved but that tool now managed to

533
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,600
uh kind of like predict pollutants in

534
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:17,200
time to say like hey when a pollutant is

535
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,640
being detected abnormally at upstream

536
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,960
rivers then by this and this time it

537
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,159
it's going to flow to the border to the

538
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,559
Netherlands and things like this and so

539
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,960
this is something that

540
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,320
when being used correctly can really

541
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,120
benefit maybe the lives of per region of

542
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,520
people like I don't know I don't know

543
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,240
the future usage of this tool but the

544
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,799
implementation of it the intention

545
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,799
behind developing this kind of tools uh

546
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,480
in this project

547
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,400
oh sorry to interrupt

548
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,120
no all good so this is one of the one of

549
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,279
the examples of saying some of the

550
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,760
projects that I feel proud of

551
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:05,520
yeah yeah that that that makes sense

552
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,679
just um explain a bit uh the the

553
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,240
difference because that's where I think

554
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,000
it gets confusing for for people for

555
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:17,760
example for this last project is it um

556
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,720
generative AI is it deep learning it is

557
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,480
traditional machine learning um

558
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,039
statistical machine learning

559
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,400
okay what does it mean

560
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,400
it is not even

561
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,120
the classical machine learning like we

562
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,080
just use statistics as the background

563
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,840
algorithm of it.

564
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,039
Okay. So,

565
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,600
no geni,

566
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,080
Mhm.

567
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,679
no deep learning,

568
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,640
no neuron networks,

569
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
not even random forest. It's just pure

570
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,120
statistics.

571
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,279
Yeah.

572
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,520
Often times this is just enough to solve

573
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,120
the problem reliably.

574
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:03,200
Mhm. because there is maybe a tendency

575
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,720
now to use generative AI with these

576
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:10,559
large language models for to solve any

577
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,960
kind of problems or I there is this um

578
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,279
possibility at least right

579
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,880
and um from simple things like using CH

580
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:24,720
GPT as a as a consumer as a user and you

581
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,080
are asking it to to translate Apple to

582
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,640
Italian

583
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,919
and it's like using um I don't know

584
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,360
atomic bomb to to kill a mosquito right

585
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,399
I heard someone saying that

586
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,399
because we we I mean we can think about

587
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:47,760
it but um the normal people using chip

588
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:50,159
doesn't realize that it's it's a huge

589
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:54,880
technology right and there are data

590
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:57,440
centers and transformers and all

591
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,399
incredible technology behind it that

592
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,120
runs for for every simple uh

593
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,080
conversation that you have with JGPT,

594
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,600
right?

595
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,640
While for many many things it's it's not

596
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,440
needed that

597
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,559
so intelligent technology, you know what

598
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,559
I mean?

599
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,080
Yeah. But I would say that's a big

600
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:24,399
distinction between um

601
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:29,039
between the predictive modeling models

602
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:31,039
with uh Genai or LM models because

603
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,080
predictive modeling is largely

604
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:38,000
discriminative models and then the LM

605
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,720
like the things that you know Chad or

606
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,360
whoever's coined the term like AI the

607
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,480
big umbrella term they are largely

608
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,520
generative

609
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,320
And so they have different usage. So in

610
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,799
in terms of like what you say you know I

611
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,640
I want to do translation then a

612
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,080
generative model can do that very well

613
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,760
because um you know you can you can put

614
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,159
like a like a you know good prom and

615
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,240
then it's going to come up with an

616
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,840
equivalent version of like the

617
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,679
translation.

618
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:15,760
But then in predictive modeling projects

619
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:18,799
what it needs is not creativity. What it

620
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,880
needs is not generating new stuff but to

621
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:26,720
reliably based on past data points to

622
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,559
accurately predict things. So if you

623
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,440
take time series forecasting as an

624
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,960
example, uh maybe they have very sparse

625
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:39,760
data. They don't need a model

626
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:42,480
like an LM to tell, hey, can you help me

627
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,360
detect anomalies at which point in time

628
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,600
when this happens? Because a generative

629
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,320
model is most likely to make things up.

630
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,240
But a predictive model, a discriminative

631
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,679
model is going to train the model based

632
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,559
on the past data. And then if the

633
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,760
quality is good and if the model is has

634
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:07,919
been trained successfully, it can then

635
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:10,640
accurately predict in time uh what would

636
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,720
be the what would the ano

637
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,840
anomaly be? Yeah. So they are for kind

638
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:22,559
of like different usage and that is why

639
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:27,200
I think there are certain use cases for

640
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:30,159
um LMS there are certain use cases that

641
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,240
um the discriminative machine learning

642
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,399
models or statistical models will still

643
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,000
be in in demand because they are

644
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,240
inherently for different different

645
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,120
things.

646
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,760
What's the the current or or next thing

647
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,320
that you would like to to work on?

648
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,880
What's what that excites you right now?

649
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,159
What are you uh I don't know

650
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,640
experimenting with for a future client

651
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,600
project or

652
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,679
um I think right now I was still focused

653
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,000
on becoming a problem solver for worthy

654
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,039
problems. So

655
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,200
for every project that comes um it's

656
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:13,679
important for me to to satisfy

657
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,519
like to be convinced of the for what and

658
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:21,600
for who. So if you if you come with me

659
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:24,000
that says hey we we we want a water

660
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,760
pollutant monitoring system

661
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,880
to do this and it's going to be used by

662
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,399
uh used by this and this person.

663
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,519
If

664
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,000
I feel convinced of this like okay like

665
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,600
goes aligns with my values I'm going to

666
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,320
say yes because to me based on my

667
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,320
previous experience in academia in

668
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,919
industry I know where to look for

669
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,279
solutions

670
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,960
and so it's like right now the tools

671
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:59,120
that I have in my toolbox is machine

672
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:02,559
learning deep learning statistics

673
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,360
LMS engineering and so for all of those

674
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,840
things paired with software engineering

675
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,200
you can basically look for any solutions

676
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,960
you can you can come up with any

677
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,720
solutions but what I think is

678
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,039
um

679
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,039
as long as there is a worthy problem to

680
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:24,240
solve then it doesn't matter what does

681
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:27,760
it take because every

682
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,720
freelance project that I'm taking on

683
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,559
it's just so different and So back to

684
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,480
your question is kind of like it doesn't

685
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,919
matter what problem for me to solve. I

686
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,600
know I have the toolbox. I I have enough

687
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,120
cards to pull out and

688
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,080
fundamentally I know where to look for

689
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,720
solutions. Um and so for me right now

690
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,640
right now it's kind of like yeah if a

691
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,200
data science problem comes to me then

692
00:33:52,640 --> 00:34:00,080
great. If a predictive modeling plus LM

693
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,080
um project comes to me then great. Um

694
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm just looking for worthy problems to

695
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,519
solve.

696
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,079
So

697
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,919
back to to your beginning now you know

698
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:15,359
how to make the magic happen. So you're

699
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:18,320
more focused on make sure that it aligns

700
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,119
with you, right? You keep repeating this

701
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,040
for

702
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:25,119
for what and for

703
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,359
for who? Yeah. And so you you you just

704
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,679
search for alignment there. That's the

705
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,839
important part for you. And then you

706
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:37,919
know that you you have so many tools now

707
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:41,520
uh that you can find a solution, right?

708
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,839
Yeah, that's a very good uh depiction of

709
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,720
where I'm going. Uh I'm also I'm also

710
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,639
interested to you know like go back to

711
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,879
my main expertise which is computer

712
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,560
vision. I feel like that is getting so

713
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,320
much less practice since I left uh my

714
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,440
master's degree.

715
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,079
Okay. So, you would like to work on that

716
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,480
again?

717
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,200
Mhm.

718
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,320
Yeah. It would be great. It's so fun.

719
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
Yeah.

720
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,040
Yeah.

721
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,119
Yeah. Search for it, right? They are

722
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,520
Yeah.

723
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,560
Just need some good portfolio items and

724
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,839
then I will start applying.

725
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,440
Cool.

726
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,000
And um the I guess the the other correct

727
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,640
me if I'm wrong the other

728
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,599
big part for for you uh I don't know if

729
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,320
it is alpha alpha or or different is

730
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:34,480
helping other people

731
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,839
in their freelancing or business uh

732
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,359
journey right?

733
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,280
Yeah that's how we met.

734
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,480
Yeah that's how we met. Yeah.

735
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:48,560
and and yeah you shared with me many

736
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,720
things with about personal growth and

737
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,800
everything related to this kind of

738
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:58,079
journey but how how it started for you

739
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,040
uh when what you decided to I guess

740
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,599
before then that uh from what what I

741
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,560
know about your journey

742
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,760
when did you

743
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:14,000
started to have the desire or conviction

744
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:18,160
to uh be a freelancer, be independent,

745
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,839
uh something happened there.

746
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:25,280
So the first time that I I

747
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,800
dabble into freelancing was 2020 and at

748
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,920
that time

749
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,720
so I continue on the story uh that we

750
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,440
left off just now. I I started three

751
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,240
years uh for my masters

752
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,040
uh in intelligent adaptive systems and

753
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,000
afterwards I took on a full-time job as

754
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,640
a data science consultant which means my

755
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,359
company sent me to different

756
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,839
organizations and enterprises across

757
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:56,320
Germany to work on data science projects

758
00:36:53,839 --> 00:37:00,480
um for those companies

759
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,800
and afterwards um in 2020 shortly before

760
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,520
that I feel like this doesn't align with

761
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,800
me so much. And so I quit.

762
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,480
Um and I said like I really want to you

763
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,960
know like try to be you know

764
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,920
establishing myself and see um how is it

765
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,960
being self-employed. Um and I tried

766
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:26,400
that. Um but at that time I feel like

767
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:30,320
it's also like how do you say it's also

768
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,640
like an opportunity come by where back

769
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,000
in my master's time I was already

770
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,960
interested in things to do with medical

771
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,760
healthcare with machine learning

772
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,440
and in the middle of doing freelancing

773
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,240
this PhD opportunity came to me and so I

774
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,200
took on this PhD opportunity and working

775
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,839
that many hours which means I have to uh

776
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,200
you know like give up on freelancing. Uh

777
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,960
but then I only took on this uh research

778
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,040
position for two years and then I

779
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,240
decided to quit again. So first

780
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,400
freelancing experience as in 2020 like

781
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,359
it doesn't last very long. I think at

782
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,119
most like half a year, one year and then

783
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:17,280
I started properly um after I end the

784
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,760
contract on this research position. Um

785
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,480
and that was

786
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,480
maybe 202

787
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:34,000
4. Oh wait, 2023 2024 304. So I was

788
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,440
being given a golden opportunity again

789
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,079
because that time Dave just happens to

790
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,520
open up this data freelancer program and

791
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:47,680
then I had the privilege to join the

792
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,480
program uh in the first year and I could

793
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,720
still remember how much Dave and the

794
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
community has helped me. You know in the

795
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,400
first year it's a smaller group and

796
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,400
everybody is kind of like very close

797
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,520
together. Um and Dave is like hosting

798
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,119
this Q&A calls like he still does um

799
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,119
today. And then I I started freelancing

800
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,839
properly using what was being taught in

801
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:16,400
the program. Like I essentially

802
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:20,000
apply tried to apply everything. Um, and

803
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,839
a year after that, I think

804
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,200
a year

805
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,880
after that, then Dave just says, "Hey,

806
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,240
we need a customer success manager and

807
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,839
coach. Um, would you be interested to

808
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,640
take on this position?" And then I was I

809
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,079
was just being humbled by the trust that

810
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,320
Dave uh put on me. I feel like Dave um

811
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,480
customer success is not written anywhere

812
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,800
on my resume.

813
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,280
But thanks for trusting me. It seems

814
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,119
like a very meaningful role to take on.

815
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm willing to try. Like let's let's

816
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,560
give it a try. And now it's been like

817
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
one and a half years.

818
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,400
Okay. Yeah. Like there is so much I feel

819
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,079
to unpack there. uh when when you

820
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,320
started

821
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:13,280
uh freelancing and and you you you felt

822
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,760
that you needed help

823
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,599
uh so you you search for or you you come

824
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,160
across uh Dave uh from from YouTube I

825
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,119
guess.

826
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,599
Yeah.

827
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:28,079
And and and joined the program. What

828
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:33,520
what was that uh you needed back then?

829
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:36,400
M so when when Dave's program came out

830
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,560
um I actually before this so in 2020 I

831
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,760
already joined some like freelancing

832
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,599
programs but that one was more like it's

833
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,000
either general freelancing or like a

834
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,560
python based so it's not exactly like

835
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,480
machine learning so when Dave's program

836
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,520
is there I know that he's a data

837
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,760
scientist and he's um doing very

838
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:01,920
successfully in freelancing as a data a

839
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,839
scientist and his demeanor is just very

840
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,119
you know down to earth as we know and

841
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:12,160
very smart and then I like that he walks

842
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:14,240
the talk. Um that is the the the the

843
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,400
decision where I decided to kind of like

844
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,560
reach out and express my interest to

845
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:25,000
join a program. Um what I think I needed

846
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,000
at that time is to

847
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,200
is to essentially

848
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,760
see that I can do it

849
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,839
and I appreciate any kinds of guidance

850
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,880
that if anybody who has walked the talk

851
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:48,000
like walked this path before to see my

852
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:52,000
blind spot to give me some advice case

853
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,359
that I can apply for myself. Um this is

854
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,160
why like this is mainly why um the re

855
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:03,359
the the the relevance of the program

856
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,040
itself paired with thinking that I need

857
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,720
some

858
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,839
I need somebody experience who was on

859
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,880
this journey doing very successfully and

860
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,599
I can resonate with to help me to go

861
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,520
through this process.

862
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:26,880
Yeah, makes sense, right? And what what

863
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:29,520
are some um I guess limiting beliefs or

864
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,760
something that you personally struggle

865
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:36,480
with during during that that first year

866
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,680
is something that comes to mind or not?

867
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:44,160
Yes. I told Dave uh in a later

868
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,160
interview, I said uh Dave, I didn't have

869
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,240
confidence. I outsource my confidence to

870
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,640
you and thanks to you, I'm here. I'm in

871
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,599
the game.

872
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,000
I I think you you told me that phrase

873
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,599
the first time that we met. I wrote it

874
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,800
down and I

875
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,400
I I always remember that.

876
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,599
Yeah. And I'm trying to do that to all

877
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,599
the community members now. Like I'm like

878
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,200
I know what you need um based on based

879
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,800
based on the fact that I'm also in the

880
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,960
game.

881
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,200
Um

882
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,599
And so

883
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,079
if you

884
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,800
if you can leave the rest to us and then

885
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,319
just say I want to go here, we'll help

886
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,119
you get there. And so in a way uh I'm

887
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,000
trying to be outsourced the confidence

888
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,520
as I as I unknowingly outsourced they my

889
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,480
confidence before. Yeah.

890
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:44,319
Yeah. we are now passing on right to to

891
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,240
to us to to the other rest of the people

892
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,079
in in the community.

893
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,760
Yeah. But I also think it's my pleasure

894
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:57,520
like it it it is just such a pleasure to

895
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,760
to witness everybody's journey because

896
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,800
oh it's better than movies is better

897
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,560
than watching movie movies.

898
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,960
I look at your experience, I look at

899
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,400
your journey like um from the first time

900
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,720
that we talk

901
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,960
and until today you have grown a lot and

902
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,000
you have also achieved some things along

903
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,880
the way

904
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,440
and so this takes like you know you see

905
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,680
a real life scenario in different people

906
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,520
you see the stories in different people.

907
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,560
Um

908
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,760
I think

909
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,680
I think my role is just to remind

910
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,960
everybody

911
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:38,960
what they know already within themsel. I

912
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,960
just reinforce that Nicola based on what

913
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:46,480
we talk I think you are this and this

914
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:49,680
person. Um, if this is your goal, I help

915
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:53,680
you hold the the your your ideal self in

916
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,960
my mind. And in my mind, every goal that

917
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,920
you told me that you're going to

918
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,960
achieve, I consider it I consider it

919
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,000
done already. And now I'm just walking

920
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,760
this process with you. But in my mind,

921
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,160
it's already done. and I'm just waiting

922
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,079
for one day in the future that you'll

923
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,640
come back to tell me that says I'm

924
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,240
already in my ideal self and and I'll be

925
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,599
just like, you know, I knew it. I knew

926
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:22,400
it a long time ago.

927
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:25,359
Yeah, that that makes sense. But um

928
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,160
what now that you have seen people going

929
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:32,079
going through this, what what are the

930
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,680
skills to be coachable?

931
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,599
What are the skills to be coachable?

932
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,760
Wow, that's such a great question. Let

933
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,760
me think.

934
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,119
I think it's mostly

935
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,319
the humility

936
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:51,280
to see a different perspective of the

937
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,920
story.

938
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,040
What do you mean?

939
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,920
a lot of people.

940
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:04,720
Um, so

941
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:08,440
in my experience, I feel that I cannot

942
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,440
help those people

943
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:15,440
who cannot believe in another

944
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,960
version of narration.

945
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,599
So

946
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,839
what they want is

947
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,800
I'm stuck here.

948
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,359
don't convince me otherwise and then

949
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,599
they try to

950
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:32,560
they're not receptive

951
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,839
to the other things. So I would say

952
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:39,200
first of all the humility to accept that

953
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:42,920
reality has different narration and you

954
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,920
just have to

955
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:50,160
rather than seeing it as good or bad

956
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,480
see it as pros and cons

957
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,920
and then see yourself as one avatar in

958
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,160
the sandbox and says I'm here this is

959
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:02,640
where I want to go what is beneficial

960
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,800
for me to take And people with nar a

961
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,040
certain narration they are very you know

962
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,400
very convinced of something

963
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,000
when I see that it this convincing

964
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,640
reality

965
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:20,800
does not serve them uh and if they if

966
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:23,359
they are not ready to accept other

967
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,599
possibilities other narration that says

968
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:30,560
hey maybe you can look into here and

969
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:32,960
that um I I think if they are very

970
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,560
if if they decide to stay in this

971
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,920
narration, there's nothing that I can

972
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,119
do.

973
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,000
I see.

974
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,480
Yeah. Oh, so this is one. Second would

975
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,040
be accountability.

976
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,400
Okay.

977
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:50,520
This is what we do every week, Nicola.

978
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,520
I know that part well.

979
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,079
Okay. But

980
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,920
accountability, do they follow up? Do

981
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:01,280
they follow through um with with the

982
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,720
things that they should be doing? They

983
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,079
said they would do.

984
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,640
Yeah. So,

985
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,160
because action moves the needle, right?

986
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,960
Mhm.

987
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,960
Yeah.

988
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. I I was

989
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,960
curious to to dig a bit deeper on on the

990
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:20,640
first part that you uh what you said,

991
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,880
right? So I'm hearing that if someone

992
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,599
as

993
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,920
their own narration,

994
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:32,480
so it like a story that they tell

995
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:36,559
themselves and they they are not willing

996
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:40,480
to see another story,

997
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:44,880
but they want to to get somewhere

998
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:48,400
uh to their goals. and you you help them

999
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:53,040
realize that uh to get there they need

1000
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:56,240
to to change uh the narration

1001
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,200
right so if they are not flexible in

1002
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,839
that way or they don't listen that there

1003
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,800
is another

1004
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:08,160
uh narration there is another story that

1005
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,319
serves you better to to get there

1006
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,200
um

1007
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:15,520
it's difficult to to about someone stuck

1008
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,880
in that situation. Is that what what you

1009
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,359
mean?

1010
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,599
Yeah. So if they if they feel that it is

1011
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:26,559
more

1012
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:30,160
it is more valuable to hold on to the

1013
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:34,000
current narration that put them in

1014
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,000
current situation and they are not ready

1015
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,960
to

1016
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,880
see elsewhere. You know, like even to be

1017
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,520
open for the possibility the other

1018
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,359
generation of maybe there's some other

1019
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,240
things that you can still try or maybe

1020
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:51,200
there is some interpretation of your

1021
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,079
assumptions uh that you can maybe tweak

1022
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,319
a little bit maybe

1023
00:49:54,079 --> 00:50:01,119
maybe that that can be that can move you

1024
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:04,400
forward a little bit. So um

1025
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:07,359
yeah, so if if they

1026
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,520
if they feel more secure by holding on

1027
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,520
to this

1028
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,160
this narration,

1029
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,400
um I will honor that. I will make space

1030
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,640
I I will make space for that as well to

1031
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,440
say that it's okay. I can see that

1032
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:28,079
you're not ready to

1033
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:32,559
to to explore or this narration. um uh

1034
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:38,319
at this moment. And so um

1035
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:41,599
I I I feel that it is also important to

1036
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:43,839
make them feel okay that this narration

1037
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,559
right now that

1038
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:50,079
they they hold like they hug like

1039
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:54,240
hugging a lock just to not drown. Um,

1040
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:58,720
it's okay to acknowledge that and give

1041
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:00,880
space for them to do this until they are

1042
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,040
ready again.

1043
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,720
Okay. Yeah.

1044
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,720
Yeah. I recognize you're you have this

1045
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,720
um

1046
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,680
way of helping people.

1047
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,720
Uh yeah that is uh you know everyone has

1048
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:22,400
their own uh

1049
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:25,359
way of going through coach someone in in

1050
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,160
these situations right uh there are some

1051
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:34,240
more I don't know how to call it more

1052
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:37,839
strict in a way uh but you can

1053
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,599
go and and take someone from where they

1054
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,079
are

1055
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,960
uh as you've said acknowledge that they

1056
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:49,359
In this moment they might need something

1057
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:53,520
else right that you cannot force them uh

1058
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:56,640
right that is a more gradual journey

1059
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,760
uh that comes with with whatever time

1060
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,800
and type of journey uh someone needs

1061
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,480
right

1062
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,319
have you heard about the story of the

1063
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,240
mushroom man

1064
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:10,079
mushroom? No.

1065
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,520
Okay. So tell me um

1066
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,839
I've watched this story from the

1067
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,760
internet so I don't know where to site

1068
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,559
this from but this story stuck with my

1069
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,200
head

1070
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,760
and I've been I've been secretly

1071
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,680
applying to all of you guys all along.

1072
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,599
Oh let's see.

1073
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,960
So

1074
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,280
so the mushroom man is

1075
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,559
there's a guy who is so convinced that

1076
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:37,200
he is a mushroom he's not a human. Okay.

1077
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,520
So, a guy is so convinced that he's a

1078
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,839
mushroom and so he just take this

1079
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,319
umbrella and then just stood on one side

1080
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:46,400
all along like he just wants to be a

1081
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,599
mushroom. Like he's so convinced that

1082
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,119
he's a mushroom.

1083
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,680
Yeah.

1084
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,000
And then of course other people who care

1085
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,839
for him will say like you're not a

1086
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
mushroom, you're human. Like come on.

1087
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,559
It's like look at yourself. You don't

1088
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,559
look like a mushroom. But that guy is

1089
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,480
just so convinced to be a mushroom and

1090
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:09,280
nobody can change his mind. Um, and so

1091
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,000
one day a person comes along

1092
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,079
and just take another umbrella and just

1093
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,359
sit next to him.

1094
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,119
And then that mushroom guy said, "Hey,

1095
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,359
what are you doing here?" And then that

1096
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:24,359
guy just says like, "I'm also a

1097
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,359
mushroom."

1098
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,760
And then that guy says, "Huh? Oh, we're

1099
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,480
mushroom friends now." And then after,

1100
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,400
you know, sitting sitting with that guy

1101
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:39,599
for for some time that that guy just

1102
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,359
started to stand and walk.

1103
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,240
And then the mushroom man just freaked

1104
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:46,400
out. And then that mushroom man is like,

1105
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,599
"Hey, you're a mushroom. How can you do

1106
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,520
this?" And then that guy just said, "You

1107
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,680
don't know. It's 2025. Mushrooms can

1108
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,240
walk."

1109
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:59,119
And then that guy says, "Huh,

1110
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:01,200
interesting. are you okay? Mushroom can

1111
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,280
walk. And he said, "Of course, all

1112
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,440
mushrooms can walk this year, starting

1113
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,160
this year." And then that mushroom guy

1114
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:12,079
just stand up and walk.

1115
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,240
And so the moral of the story is

1116
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,520
um

1117
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:20,960
righteousness is not my goal in

1118
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,000
coaching. um the intention to making

1119
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,480
somebody um seeing the potential in

1120
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,119
somebody that this person is not a

1121
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,640
mushroom, it's a human and he has the

1122
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:35,680
place that he needs to go. Um I don't

1123
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:39,839
have to be right. I just have to try my

1124
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:43,440
best to have the intention to get this

1125
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:46,720
person into where they want to go.

1126
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,640
Yeah. Now it it makes Yeah, definitely.

1127
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,160
It's how we are helping us. It makes

1128
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,079
sense.

1129
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,000
Now you know my trick.

1130
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,160
Yeah.

1131
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,559
No, this is great. Yeah. Like I mean

1132
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:05,440
it's these stories help you to fix fix

1133
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:08,319
some some ideas but know I I see uh you

1134
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,920
know where where

1135
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:14,559
from where you you come from and uh

1136
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:18,640
different people need different things.

1137
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:22,319
Someone works better with a carrot and

1138
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,960
stick approach and someone it's it's a

1139
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,680
mush someone is a mushroom and they need

1140
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,920
a different approach to this uh yeah

1141
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,040
that yeah I can relate to that makes

1142
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,480
makes sense and

1143
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,200
yeah it just happened that I don't have

1144
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,680
to be right. I don't have to I don't

1145
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,040
need to have another people told me that

1146
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,599
I'm right

1147
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:44,400
for me to feel good about myself. Like I

1148
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:47,040
just like I care about another person

1149
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,920
and for this care uh I would do my best.

1150
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,520
I know I know my goal my goal is not to

1151
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,040
be right.

1152
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:58,640
Mhm. Is to to get someone where they

1153
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:00,720
want to go. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So that's

1154
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,839
that's let's let's say the first uh

1155
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:06,000
skill that that that you mentioned

1156
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,680
and the second important one is

1157
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,160
accountability right

1158
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:14,400
and and so why some of us

1159
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:18,319
as everyone

1160
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:22,799
some sometimes we we are not able to do

1161
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:26,440
what we say that uh we want to do why we

1162
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,440
need that accountability

1163
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,000
accountability

1164
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:35,119
helps you make progress and there can be

1165
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,559
many reasons why

1166
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:40,720
you cannot do what you wanted to do. You

1167
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,680
might be lacking

1168
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:46,559
skills. You might be lacking some tools.

1169
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,480
You might be lacking the permission that

1170
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,240
only you can give to yourself. And

1171
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,280
another people just have to remind you

1172
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:56,160
that um

1173
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,280
the power is not outside, the power is

1174
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,319
inside.

1175
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,079
M

1176
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:04,480
and these are the things that I think in

1177
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:07,040
life we just rely on the kindness of

1178
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,680
another person to help you move forward.

1179
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,680
And that is how we

1180
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,400
that is how we choose to interact with

1181
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,799
the world to

1182
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,000
to be willing to accept the goodness

1183
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,720
from other people and then pass it

1184
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,280
forward.

1185
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:29,280
Okay.

1186
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:32,720
Okay. Yeah. You're I was I was expecting

1187
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:36,480
a totally different uh totally different

1188
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,640
answer and I'm realizing Yeah. that I

1189
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,980
don't know it in the couple last days

1190
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,359
I'm now I'm connecting random dots

1191
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,960
[Music]

1192
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:48,000
excuse me if it doesn't make sense but

1193
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:51,200
no I think it makes some sense because

1194
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,680
there when I think about accountability

1195
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,960
or these kind of topics

1196
00:57:53,680 --> 00:58:00,319
uh coaching and and people going through

1197
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,720
some personal development journey I feel

1198
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:06,000
the

1199
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:10,079
predominant narrative online, especially

1200
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,400
YouTube or the the influences that I see

1201
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:16,720
thanks to the algorithm algorithm of

1202
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:20,559
whatever are quite strong, right? You

1203
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:24,000
know, more masculine energy in a way

1204
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:27,359
the Tony Robbins or

1205
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,359
this kind of motivational stuff, right?

1206
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,880
Make sense? Mhm.

1207
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:34,640
While

1208
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:38,000
in in your answer, I feel definitely a

1209
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:41,040
different energy uh that is not the

1210
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,599
predominant one because predominant is

1211
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:47,520
louder and definitely

1212
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:50,160
more masculine. I I feel there

1213
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:53,680
at least uh yeah, as I said, what what

1214
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:56,960
we see online etc is more men doing

1215
00:58:53,680 --> 00:59:01,040
this. at least what what I receive from

1216
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:04,880
the algorithm and while the your angle

1217
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:07,280
is is is different in this. Yeah. And

1218
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,920
it's it's a it's good that there is

1219
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,079
another angle, right? And that we

1220
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,559
normally don't don't see

1221
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,160
what

1222
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,960
Yeah. I'm glad that I contribute a

1223
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:21,760
little bit to that. Uh but I also see

1224
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:23,839
that um I think you just have to look um

1225
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,599
advice like this also exists on the

1226
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:30,000
internet. Um I think it's more like if

1227
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,839
if you don't realize like you just don't

1228
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,760
know what you don't know. I think this

1229
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:35,040
happens with a lot of people and

1230
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,440
especially the the design of the

1231
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,839
algorithm is more like bubble like like

1232
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,559
you get more of what you look at and

1233
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:45,040
what you consume and so you you know

1234
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,960
from time to time look the other side.

1235
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,720
Yeah.

1236
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,520
You have some recommendation for the

1237
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,760
other side. What what what are some

1238
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,040
resources or some people that influenced

1239
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:00,280
you?

1240
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:00,280
Oh, resources and people. Um,

1241
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,440
I don't know where do I start. It's like

1242
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:09,680
in the in which topic.

1243
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:15,440
Yeah, in this kind of uh I think now we

1244
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:17,280
are in the personal development uh or

1245
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,400
doing something that you have never done

1246
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,119
before.

1247
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,200
In this case, it's uh your business,

1248
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,040
your freelance journey. M

1249
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,839
and so there is that struggle to do

1250
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:30,960
something that you have not done before

1251
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:33,839
and so you might need what we are

1252
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:37,520
talking about right changing your story

1253
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:40,160
accountability someone that helps you. M

1254
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:43,119
so in this realm of

1255
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:46,160
personal growth

1256
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:51,520
what uh most influenced you or you like

1257
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:55,440
to read look up to go back to

1258
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:58,480
I am currently reading so go back to I

1259
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:02,240
have one principle book that helped me

1260
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:04,720
like that is the guiding light uh of of

1261
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:08,000
my life and then some supplementary

1262
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:12,880
books and Um

1263
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:17,760
but yeah I can share them. So my guiding

1264
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:21,599
principle resource is a diamond sutra by

1265
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:25,760
the Buddha and then I am currently

1266
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:27,440
reading I'm currently reading taqing by

1267
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:31,280
la.

1268
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,359
Um but they are very meta. They're very

1269
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,799
they're very like they're for people

1270
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:37,680
like me who always contemplate the

1271
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:39,920
meaning of life and but the third one

1272
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:43,280
but the third one that I can recommend

1273
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,960
is uh the way of integrity by Marta

1274
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,000
Beck.

1275
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,480
Okay. What can you tell me about these

1276
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,359
three books? Or I'm curious about the

1277
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:57,200
first one since it's your um guiding

1278
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,200
principle. What

1279
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,960
what there is in there.

1280
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:06,000
The Diamond Sutra essentially says that

1281
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,920
um everything tangible that you can see

1282
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,200
in this world

1283
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,040
um is kind of like it's ever changing.

1284
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,760
So it's kind of like a dream. It's kind

1285
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:19,280
of like a dew and like a morning dew.

1286
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:23,920
It's kind of like um illusion. It's kind

1287
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:28,400
of like a shadow. Um it's kind of like

1288
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:33,440
uh thunder. Um and we should see the

1289
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:37,839
world this way. And so that has given me

1290
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:39,839
that has given me a sense of saying that

1291
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,680
I should not kind of like try to cling

1292
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:45,440
on something.

1293
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:48,319
um I should be really fluid like if I

1294
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:52,559
want to uh enjoy the world the right

1295
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:56,400
way. Um and so one of the stories in

1296
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:58,880
there says if you're drowning and then

1297
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,880
you happen to hug a lock like a big

1298
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:05,040
piece of wood and then that has saved

1299
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,280
your life. Um but then since you're now

1300
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,240
safe like you're not drowning anymore

1301
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,839
you have come to the land but maybe out

1302
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,520
of security you feel like this lock is

1303
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:19,440
so important for you it has saved your

1304
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,440
life so you just hug it to walk it but

1305
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,480
who knows your next quest is to climb

1306
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,720
the mountain like you cannot since the

1307
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,039
lock has saved you already you should

1308
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,880
let it go because your next quest is

1309
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,559
climbing a mountain that lock is not

1310
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,280
going to serve you.

1311
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:38,839
And so that main guiding principle is

1312
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,839
kind of like say

1313
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:47,520
everything is as is happened. Um for

1314
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,920
example, our podcast now is as happened.

1315
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,319
It's going to end in I don't know like

1316
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:55,200
20 minutes time

1317
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:57,599
and I should not cling on it. I should

1318
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,000
not think about oh damn I should change

1319
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:03,839
something about it. Like also in

1320
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:07,119
freelancing it's like in freelancing

1321
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:10,000
you have to have a level of grace uh and

1322
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:12,319
compassion to yourself for the courage

1323
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,079
to come out. If you always say that I

1324
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:15,920
have to be perfect I cannot make any

1325
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,440
mistakes. Sorry. You live in a

1326
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,839
classroom. You're not living in the real

1327
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,280
world. Um if you're living in the real

1328
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:23,760
world and you don't want to get to

1329
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,400
insanity.

1330
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,480
Just try to

1331
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,119
do a small experiment. see what it comes

1332
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,280
back and if it is not the outcome that

1333
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:36,960
you want just pivot and do better next

1334
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,720
time. So like don't hug the lock when

1335
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,480
you have to climb the mountain. Yes, the

1336
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:45,240
lock has saved you. It has served you in

1337
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,240
the past but time to move on.

1338
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,760
Yeah, that that's a that's a great

1339
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:52,319
metaphor. Yeah.

1340
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,599
Yeah. So, it's kind of like

1341
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:58,720
I don't see you, Nicola, as Nicola the

1342
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:01,280
coachi because I know it just happened

1343
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:03,359
in this moment that we met and I'm being

1344
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:06,000
put in a position to give you some

1345
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:08,160
advice and you're in the position of

1346
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,720
needing some advice. But this is not

1347
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:13,440
forever. Like, this is not permanent. At

1348
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:17,280
some point, these

1349
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:19,359
three that I look after will grow. Like,

1350
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,760
you're going to be a different Nicola.

1351
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,760
And I don't see you Nicola as the first

1352
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:28,240
version anymore. Like I should see you

1353
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:30,160
as an everchanging. And it this is this

1354
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,880
is the

1355
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,880
this is what I think

1356
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,359
the the way that I prefer to look at

1357
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,720
life everything like people person

1358
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:43,599
environment everything.

1359
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:48,000
Makes me think of it. I feel it's kind

1360
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:51,599
of a translation of this um that what

1361
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,599
serves served you to to get here won't

1362
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,480
serve you to get

1363
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:58,400
somewhere else right we have different

1364
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,240
whatever phases

1365
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,240
challenges

1366
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:08,480
uh grow path and something you need

1367
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:10,799
something to get somewhere h but then it

1368
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:13,839
won't help you to get somewhere else

1369
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:17,760
because it's constantly evolving journey

1370
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:19,119
and challenges and and stuff. Yeah.

1371
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,359
Perfect. This is a perfect

1372
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:24,240
interpretation.

1373
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:26,160
Yeah. And what what about the what was

1374
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,119
the the third book that that you

1375
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,839
mentioned?

1376
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:34,079
The way of integrity by Marta Beck.

1377
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:35,200
And what's the the message from there?

1378
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,520
That one

1379
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,079
the message is to really honor your own

1380
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:43,760
truth.

1381
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:48,000
And so, uh, it described like this

1382
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:50,400
theater play by it's called Inferno. Um,

1383
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,240
so I think it's like maybe it's Italian

1384
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:57,039
story, you know, like maybe let me know.

1385
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:59,680
I I look into it. I mean, the the

1386
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,880
inferno from from Dante is where it all

1387
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,559
started. Yeah,

1388
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:06,559
it's from Dante. Yeah. M

1389
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:11,680
so that book is about taking Dante's

1390
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:15,119
inferno into examining our life. And so

1391
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:17,599
it says that it it goes through

1392
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:18,799
you have to go through the center of the

1393
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,079
earth

1394
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:24,640
and then go to the inferno and then

1395
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:27,839
coming out from the other side. And so

1396
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:31,039
that book is such a

1397
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:33,599
supernova for me like

1398
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:35,280
because

1399
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:39,039
um

1400
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:42,240
back then I just take every advice as is

1401
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:46,559
and thinking that if I apply them um I'm

1402
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:49,920
going to get success or get happier. But

1403
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:52,319
I forgot to examine myself like if that

1404
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,799
advice is made for me or not. like do I

1405
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,960
see myself in this or do I have a level

1406
01:07:54,799 --> 01:08:01,599
of understanding

1407
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:06,480
that this thing fits me or not. Um and

1408
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:10,319
the process of doing that is then to

1409
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:12,880
to find the truth slowly and that book

1410
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:16,799
the way of integrity. It's basically

1411
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:19,679
like explaining or practicing or making

1412
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:22,400
you realize what are the ways that you

1413
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:25,120
can find your own integrity. And so you

1414
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,679
have this inner truth as your anchor and

1415
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,560
everything has to filter through this

1416
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:34,480
and then you get a sense of clarity.

1417
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:39,199
um when dealing with a lot of noise.

1418
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:43,839
I see. So, it's like helping you to

1419
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:46,960
um filter the advice and what are

1420
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:50,640
what are people telling you instead of

1421
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:53,600
following uh everyone in all in every

1422
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:57,279
direction.

1423
01:08:53,600 --> 01:09:00,159
Yeah. Yeah. It's more like there are two

1424
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:03,199
kinds of heart. Um there are two kinds

1425
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:07,839
of hardness

1426
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:10,560
um that that we face. Um one kind of

1427
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:12,480
hard is if you're a fish then if you

1428
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,319
want to swim to the ocean and then you

1429
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,319
know like it's a different environment.

1430
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,480
You just have to push on right like you

1431
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,480
have a you know you be stronger as a

1432
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,560
different as a stronger fish you maybe

1433
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,400
swim faster or anything. But another

1434
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,319
kind of heart is you don't know who you

1435
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,400
are. You don't even know you're a fish.

1436
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,640
And then you're trying to compete with

1437
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:33,440
monkeys climbing the tree. And then

1438
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:37,040
you'll be stuck thinking why are the

1439
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:39,120
other monkeys just seem so so light and

1440
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,440
easy and so effortless in climbing the

1441
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:45,040
trees because you don't even know like

1442
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:47,679
and and you're kind of out of breath.

1443
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,759
You're not as good as they are. You're

1444
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,640
not achieving the height that they are,

1445
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:54,080
but you're half dying. Uh that's because

1446
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,719
you don't realize that you're a fish

1447
01:09:54,080 --> 01:10:00,400
like this is not your lane like go back

1448
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:02,000
to the water like and and you know swim

1449
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,960
towards the ocean.

1450
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,360
Yeah.

1451
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,159
Yeah.

1452
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:08,080
Did you did you

1453
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:10,560
experience some something like that?

1454
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,719
There was there was a time where you

1455
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,679
felt you were trying

1456
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,239
Yeah.

1457
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,360
to do

1458
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,520
three times.

1459
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:20,159
Yeah. Okay.

1460
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,760
three times that I have to be almost

1461
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:25,040
bedridden.

1462
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:27,120
I'm in a lot of pain uh to realize uh

1463
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,480
I'm not supposed to do certain things.

1464
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:32,239
And usually that comes in terms of

1465
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:35,120
um

1466
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:38,640
the career choice

1467
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:42,400
um and the environment

1468
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:45,520
and uh my

1469
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:48,560
attitude trying to climbing the trees.

1470
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:52,000
uh while not knowing myself. So yeah, I

1471
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:55,440
have had three burnouts in the past 10

1472
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,320
years and the first one was

1473
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:02,239
um during my software engineering time

1474
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:06,040
and the second one was during my PhD

1475
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:06,040
time and no

1476
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:11,440
during my uh data science consultant

1477
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:15,239
time and third time was during my PhD

1478
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,239
time. Uh

1479
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:24,000
And what did you realize why you were um

1480
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,159
what

1481
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,679
made it clear for you that you were

1482
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:33,480
doing what you were not supposed to do

1483
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,480
or was not.

1484
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:39,239
I realized that

1485
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:45,040
I I never think about checking in with

1486
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,360
myself

1487
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,480
if

1488
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:52,640
if being in an environment or doing a

1489
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:55,040
certain thing will make me respect

1490
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:57,679
myself more or less.

1491
01:11:55,040 --> 01:12:00,560
So I didn't

1492
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:05,040
So it's more like I keep looking out and

1493
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:06,560
then I tried doing things and I tried to

1494
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,560
come up with a good result, good

1495
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,480
performance.

1496
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:14,960
Um

1497
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:20,120
but then I don't know what I'm made of.

1498
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,120
Um so it's kind of like

1499
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,600
it's kind of like I am trying my very

1500
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,600
best

1501
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,199
just trying to survive instead of

1502
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:32,080
driving

1503
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:35,120
and that comes in many many ways maybe

1504
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,840
it is with

1505
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,760
the pace of the project maybe it's with

1506
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,760
the nature of the project maybe it's

1507
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:46,560
with the nature of the environment of

1508
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:49,600
what is demanded of you Um and

1509
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:53,280
and these kind of

1510
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:58,719
uh self-awareness came uh after taking

1511
01:12:53,280 --> 01:13:01,199
me three excruciating physical pain um

1512
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:05,640
to to realize that maybe I should look

1513
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:05,640
at what I'm made of.

1514
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:13,440
So you you feel you were ignoring maybe

1515
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:17,199
earlier signals, right? I'm ignoring all

1516
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:20,640
the subtle and obvious signals

1517
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:22,159
that until my body literally can't move

1518
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,320
anymore

1519
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:26,560
for me to say stop.

1520
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,080
Otherwise, I'll still keep moving. Like

1521
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:32,480
otherwise, I wouldn't have learned this

1522
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:35,840
lesson. So, my body was compassionate

1523
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:38,880
enough to take a breakdown

1524
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:43,600
to remind myself that hey, this is not

1525
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:45,920
you. like this is you're not

1526
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,560
it you're you're you're a different

1527
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:51,520
vehicle being put on different purpose.

1528
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,320
Yeah. What what are those signals that

1529
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:58,880
someone in in a similar situation might

1530
01:13:54,320 --> 01:14:01,440
catch before getting to

1531
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:06,000
um

1532
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:08,480
at at first I would say it is

1533
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,719
little discomfort here and there and

1534
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:13,600
that might come in terms of emotions

1535
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:18,000
that might comes in terms of sensations.

1536
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:21,760
Um and then uh the next thing would be

1537
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:24,719
you're trying to overcome them but you

1538
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,560
feel that you are slowly giving up on

1539
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,679
yourself or betraying yourself like you

1540
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:34,320
you're ser kind of like betraying your

1541
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:38,000
own truth um in order to get better if

1542
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:42,159
that make any sense. Um

1543
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:46,480
and then you keep

1544
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:49,480
giving in. So you slowly find yourself

1545
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,480
m

1546
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,080
grinding

1547
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,080
more like

1548
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,400
more like you more like you feel like

1549
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:00,400
you grind yourself off that nothing is

1550
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,719
left like you're you're you're slowly

1551
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:07,360
losing your life force instead of um

1552
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:11,199
instead of feeling like

1553
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:14,320
I'm still myself doing this.

1554
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:16,320
Yeah. It's going to feel like

1555
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:18,560
I keep running and running and running

1556
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:20,880
but for what?

1557
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,679
And maybe your logical brain is going to

1558
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,960
convince you ah it's for this you know

1559
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,560
this

1560
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,960
um

1561
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,679
nice achievement

1562
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:36,280
and it's for me to prove to myself that

1563
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,280
I can do this. Um

1564
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:42,960
but yeah um this is going to

1565
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,679
this is kind of like a slippery slope

1566
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,840
where you you betray yourself again and

1567
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,320
again and again.

1568
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,520
Yeah.

1569
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,960
Yeah. And

1570
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,360
those are the signs.

1571
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,920
Definitely

1572
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,280
it happens.

1573
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,080
Those are the signs and then you you

1574
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:00,719
wake up and then you think like why am I

1575
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:02,480
doing this? Like like where am I?

1576
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,400
Yeah. Exactly. I wanted to say exactly

1577
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,960
the same,

1578
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,640
but it happened to me in the in the past

1579
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,840
going

1580
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:14,320
into work in the morning,

1581
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:18,480
you know, you you get there, you sit at

1582
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:21,679
your desk, you look around, and you say,

1583
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:24,480
"What am I doing here?"

1584
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,120
Yeah. Time to look inside.

1585
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,920
Yeah.

1586
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:30,920
There's a message for you. Read the

1587
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,920
message.

1588
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:37,920
I see. And so you it's interesting you

1589
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:41,199
you you said that this happened to you

1590
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:43,840
um three times. So it was different

1591
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:47,760
things that you discovered

1592
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:51,679
or you went you went back to uh

1593
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:56,040
something similar that I don't know uh

1594
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:56,040
catch you in a different way.

1595
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:03,280
Same feeling, different environment,

1596
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:06,159
different faces, different projects, but

1597
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:08,880
the feeling is the same.

1598
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:12,080
The feeling is that

1599
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:15,040
I didn't stop myself right there

1600
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:19,520
and allow myself to do the things or be

1601
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:24,679
somewhere or well generally do something

1602
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,679
that make myself respect me less.

1603
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:31,840
That's the that the that's the question

1604
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:35,840
that I didn't think of questioning

1605
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:37,920
myself back then. If this would be my

1606
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,800
decision filtering process that would

1607
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:44,080
make a lot of life easier.

1608
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:46,159
I see. And there there were there was a

1609
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:49,199
part of you

1610
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:52,199
in the second and or third time that

1611
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,199
says

1612
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:58,239
why you you felt again into this or or

1613
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,800
not.

1614
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:04,320
No, second and third time I managed to

1615
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,760
catch myself easier. Um and being

1616
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,400
different from the first time, the first

1617
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,560
time is kind of like I just graduated

1618
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:14,000
university. This is my very first job. I

1619
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:17,920
have to do my very best as a A+ student,

1620
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,520
you know, like score perfectly uh for

1621
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,360
everything that I do.

1622
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,520
Um

1623
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:25,520
when I had the first burnout, I actually

1624
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,760
doubted myself like I actually asked

1625
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,960
myself like why am I so useless? Like

1626
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:32,480
why can't I do this? Um but second and

1627
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,920
third time, no like second and third

1628
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:38,239
time it's like ah there it goes again. I

1629
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:41,120
thought I have pivoted but looks like I

1630
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:43,040
have not pivoted enough.

1631
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:47,679
I see. Okay,

1632
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:51,600
makes sense. There there was some

1633
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:55,280
you feel external pressure especially in

1634
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:58,280
the first time or something that you

1635
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,280
um

1636
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,920
that it was coming from

1637
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:07,520
from the past or something that you'd

1638
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:11,120
learned when when you were younger um

1639
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:15,520
that you needed to be this A+ student uh

1640
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:19,360
score everything at uh the best you felt

1641
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:21,280
like some external pressure back then.

1642
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:26,199
I wouldn't think it's an external

1643
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:26,199
pressure. I think it is more like the

1644
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:35,760
I misunderstood myself.

1645
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:38,760
um only recently two to three years ago

1646
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,760
that

1647
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:44,800
I change my perspective on my existence

1648
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,120
in the world.

1649
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:50,640
So

1650
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:52,560
only up until two to three years

1651
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:57,199
ago,

1652
01:19:52,560 --> 01:20:01,679
I used to think that my existence is to

1653
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:06,400
be of use by others, is to

1654
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:09,760
lose my shapes and forms and then

1655
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:13,360
putting myself down to the dust and to

1656
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:15,679
just serve others. And that is love

1657
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:18,480
and that is contribution.

1658
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:22,080
And that was my thinking

1659
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:25,280
back then. Um

1660
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:28,480
and yeah, well since this last two to

1661
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:30,800
three years, I've changed a lot.

1662
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:34,800
I'm living a much better life right now.

1663
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:38,080
Uh and continue to do better. But yeah

1664
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:41,520
um that that that

1665
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:45,280
shift in perspective that I am my own

1666
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:47,280
person. I have my shapes and forms and

1667
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,360
boundaries. This is where I end. This is

1668
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:54,880
where others start.

1669
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:58,000
Uh I can have my own preference. Uh I

1670
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:00,960
exist in the world. Therefore

1671
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,719
I have the right to interact with the

1672
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,280
world as me.

1673
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:08,320
Um, that might sound crazy for a lot of

1674
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:10,480
people hearing this right now, but this

1675
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:12,239
is seriously, if I want to be totally

1676
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:15,520
honest,

1677
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:19,840
I only started

1678
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:23,840
embodying that two to three years ago.

1679
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:26,640
Yeah, I I think it most people are are

1680
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:29,440
struggling with that is is not not

1681
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,960
strange or maybe it's strange for

1682
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,480
someone because they have not thought

1683
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,640
about that.

1684
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,960
But uh

1685
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,920
maybe

1686
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:39,120
I'm not going that I'm irreversible

1687
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,080
anymore.

1688
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:44,480
I'm not going back. Never ever.

1689
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,760
Of course not. Yeah.

1690
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:49,040
No.

1691
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,800
Yeah. That's yeah that's amazing that

1692
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:53,760
that

1693
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:56,560
you have been able to to do that you

1694
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:59,360
know it takes

1695
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,760
it takes um some people it takes a lot

1696
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:05,360
of time and

1697
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,600
you don't even realize because when when

1698
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:10,239
the past you

1699
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:15,440
were not realizing was not realizing

1700
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:18,719
what was happening right uh or not fully

1701
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:21,920
uh to be able to to break out of it and

1702
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:26,000
as you said understand your boundaries

1703
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:30,560
and that you exist for yourself with

1704
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:33,520
your own tastes and goals etc etc

1705
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:37,440
you're not living just for the others

1706
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:41,840
and it's amazing to see you shine now

1707
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:47,040

1708
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:49,280
